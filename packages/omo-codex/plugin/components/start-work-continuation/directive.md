<start-work-continuation>

You are mid-flight on a Prometheus work plan; this turn is an automatic continuation. Do NOT ask whether to continue — the contract is auto-continue until every top-level checkbox is `- [x]`.

# State

- Plan: `{{PLAN_NAME}}`
- Plan file: `{{PLAN_PATH}}`
- Boulder state: `{{BOULDER_PATH}}`
- Remaining top-level checkboxes: `{{REMAINING_COUNT}}` of `{{TOTAL_COUNT}}`
- Next incomplete task: `{{NEXT_TASK_LABEL}}`
{{WORKTREE_BLOCK}}
- Ledger: `{{LEDGER_PATH}}`
- Your session id in boulder.json: `codex:{{SESSION_ID}}`

# What to do this turn

1. Read `{{PLAN_PATH}}` AND `{{LEDGER_PATH}}` first — they are the only sources of truth for what remains and what evidence exists; do not trust your memory of prior turns.
2. Pick the FIRST unchecked top-level checkbox in `## TODOs` or `## Final Verification Wave`. Ignore nested checkboxes under Acceptance Criteria / Evidence / Definition of Done.
3. Follow the `start-work` skill in full. The skill is already loaded from your earlier turn — re-read its file at `packages/omo-codex/plugin/skills/start-work/SKILL.md` if you have lost context.
4. Apply the checkbox's tier from its ledger entry, or classify it now per the start-work skill: LIGHT (default — a narrow change inside existing layers) needs one real-surface proof of the deliverable, with auxiliary surfaces first-class for CLI- or data-shaped work, and only trigger-mapped adversarial classes; HEAVY (new module/abstraction, auth/security, external integration, schema/migration, concurrency, cross-domain refactor, care signals) takes the full per-criterion regime. When unsure, take HEAVY; never downgrade.
5. Decompose the checkbox into atomic sub-tasks. Dispatch them in PARALLEL via `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` calls in this same response unless a sub-task has a NAMED blocking dependency (input from another sub-task or shared file). Use `fork_context: false` unless full history is truly required. Put role and specialty instructions inside `message`.
6. Every sub-task message MUST be self-contained, executable, not a context handoff: start with `TASK: <imperative assignment>`, then name `DELIVERABLE`, `SCOPE`, and `VERIFY`. It must include all 7 sections and a Manual-QA channel with exact invocation (`curl`, `send-keys`, `browser:control-in-app-browser` action, `page.click`) and PASS/FAIL observable, plus ultraqa classes, artifact, and cleanup receipt. Channels: HTTP (`curl -i`); tmux (`send-keys` + `capture-pane`); browser (Codex: `browser:control-in-app-browser` first unless auth/persistent profile needed; else Chrome/agent-browser); computer use.
7. Treat every worker DoneClaim as untrusted input. Run independent AdversarialVerify before any checkbox can become FullyDone; `confirmed` is the only pass verdict, while `false-positive`, `needs-fix`, and `needs-human-review` loop back to the executor with exact feedback.
8. Use `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent` for mailbox signals, not proof of completion — a timeout only means no new mailbox update arrived; a running child is alive. For sub-tasks likely to exceed one wait cycle, require `WORKING: <task> - <current phase>` before long passes and `BLOCKED: <reason>` only when progress stops. Send `TASK STILL ACTIVE: return <deliverable> or BLOCKED: <reason>` only when the child is completed without the deliverable, ack-only, or no longer running. If that followup is still silent or ack-only, record inconclusive, do not count it as pass/review approval, close if safe, and respawn a smaller `fork_context: false` task with the missing deliverable.
9. After verification of ALL sub-tasks under this checkbox: `apply_patch` the plan to change `- [ ]` → `- [x]`, re-read the plan to confirm the count decreased, append a `task-completed` line to the ledger, then continue.
10. Do not start fresh on a sub-agent failure. Re-dispatch with a fix-message: `FAILED: <exact error>` + `Diagnosis: <observation>` + `Fix: <instruction>`.

# Hard constraints

- No production code before a failing-first proof exists: a unit test at a seam, otherwise the sub-task's Manual-QA scenario captured failing. A test that mirrors its implementation (mock-call assertions, pinned constants) is not evidence. When the change touches existing behavior, PIN it first: a baseline characterization test that passes on the unchanged code, with exact inputs, exact observable, and exact assertion. PIN → RED → GREEN → SURFACE.
- No `--dry-run` as evidence. No "should work". No "tests pass" as completion proof.
- TUI visual evidence MUST use the web terminal pattern when a task drives an OpenCode/Codex/terminal UI: capture the pane or run `node script/qa/web-terminal-visual-qa.mjs --title "<surface>" --from-file <capture.txt> --evidence-dir <dir>` (or `--command` when tmux is available), then cite `terminal.png`, `terminal.txt`, and `metadata.json`.
- No `as any` / `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error`. No deleting failing tests.
- Probe every ultraqa adversarial class whose trigger fact holds (malformed input, prompt injection, cancel/resume, stale state, dirty worktree, hung or long commands, flaky tests, misleading success output, repeated interruptions — trigger map in the start-work skill) and capture the observable for each. A clean happy-path artifact alone is NOT a PASS when an applicable class went unprobed; record skipped classes with a one-line not-applicable reason.
- Cleanup receipt is mandatory. Register each QA teardown (scripts, tmux, browser contexts, PIDs, ports, containers, temp dirs) as a todo when it spawns, then execute it. Leftover QA state = BLOCKED, not PASS.
- The worktree path (if set in boulder.json) governs every file edit and command. Do not stray into the main repo.
- PR or branch implementation/review/merge work requires a task-owned git worktree. Treat the main worktree as read-only context.
- session_ids you write to boulder.json MUST be prefixed `codex:`. Bare ids on read are legacy `opencode:`.

# Final gate

Before completion, run `review-work` and a `debugging` runtime audit; inconclusive lanes fail. Do not create a PR, PR handoff, branch handoff, merge, or final completion answer until this gate passes. For PR/branch work, stay in the task-owned worktree: create/update the PR, wait for CI/review/Cubic gates, merge by default unless explicitly opted out, then clean up. Redact secrets, tokens, credentials, auth headers, cookies, env dumps, logs, and PII.

# Stop conditions for THIS turn

- A top-level checkbox flipped to `- [x]` after the 5-phase QA gate (Phase 1 read, Phase 2 automated, Phase 3 channel scenario, Phase 4 adversarial-class probing, Phase 5 gate decision). Then the Stop hook will re-evaluate; if more checkboxes remain you will be continued again.
- 3 same-failure cycles on one sub-task → escalate via `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a rigorous reviewer. DELIVERABLE: diagnose the repeated sub-task failure and recommend the next safe action. VERIFY: cite the failing evidence.","fork_context":false})` and stop dispatch.
- Safety boundary (destructive command, secret exfiltration, production write) → stop and surface a safe substitute.
- All top-level checkboxes `- [x]` AND the Global Review and Debugging Gate passed → print the ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE block and end.

# Output discipline

- Surface only state changes: sub-agent dispatched, scenario PASS/FAIL with artifact path, checkbox marked, evidence appended.
- Do NOT print "Should I continue?", restate the plan, or recap prior turns — the Stop hook continues you; the ledger and plan are the durable record.

Begin now. Pick the next checkbox, dispatch the parallel sub-agents, verify, mark, continue.
