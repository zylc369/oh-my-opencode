# Configuration Reference

Complete reference for Oh My OpenCode plugin configuration. Every omo harness reads one unified config file, `omo.jsonc`; the legacy `oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]` files are imported once by the migration engine and are no longer read at runtime.

## Getting Started

### File Locations

One unified file configures every omo harness: the OpenCode plugin, Senpi (task, config-watch), and Codex. The legacy `oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]` files and `~/.omo/config.jsonc` are read by nothing but the migration engine (see [Migration](#migration)).

1. User layer (lowest precedence): `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` on every platform (`omo.json` is accepted as a fallback basename).
2. Project layers: `.omo/omo.jsonc` (then `.omo/omo.json`) in every directory from the working directory up to `$HOME`. Farther ancestors merge first, so the nearest project file wins and beats the user layer. `$HOME` itself is skipped by the walk because `~/.omo` is already the user layer. If the working directory is outside `$HOME`, the walk continues to the filesystem root.

#### Resolution Order

Within the merged document each harness resolves its own view VSCode-style, later layers winning:

1. Shared base keys
2. The `[harness]` block: `[opencode]`, `[native]`, or `[codex]` (`[senpi]` is the accepted legacy spelling of `[native]`)
3. `profiles.<name>`
4. `profiles.<name>.[harness]`

Defaults apply once at the end. The option keys documented in this reference are the contents of the `[opencode]` block. `agents` and `categories` can also live at the shared base level so every harness sees them, using the shared field set documented in the [omo.json reference](./omo-json.md); OpenCode-specific agent options belong in `[opencode]`.

#### Profiles

No default profiles ship: a profile exists only when you write one under `profiles.<name>` or the migration derives one from a legacy profile directory. Activation, highest priority first:

1. `OMO_PROFILE`
2. `OCX_PROFILE` (set by `ocx oc -p <name>`)
3. An `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` whose path ends in `profiles/<name>`
4. None

Activating a profile that does not exist produces a diagnostic and falls back to the base configuration.

#### Model Catalog

A top-level `models` record maps a short name to the canonical shape `{ model, reasoning? }`. Deprecated `variant` and `reasoningEffort` inputs are accepted for compatibility and normalized to `reasoning`. When an agent or category `model` string matches a catalog key, it resolves to the entry's model id and fills any unset `reasoning` from the entry; tuning written at the use site always wins. `[harness]` blocks can override individual catalog entries for one harness.

#### Model Profiles

Two more shared base keys, read by the Senpi harness, pick the main session model by lane instead of by model id. They live at the top level, inside `[native]`, or inside a `profiles.<name>` layer, like any other base key.

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model_profiles` | record<string, `{ display_name?, family?, tier?, models? }`> | Named ordered model chains. A name matching a builtin (`recommended`, `daily-normal`, `daily-heavy`, `geeky-normal`, `geeky-heavy`) replaces it wholesale; any other name adds one. Entries use the same string or object shape as a category chain and may reference `models.<catalog>` entries. |
| `model_profile` | string | Which chain starts the session: a lane id such as `daily-normal`, or a literal `provider/model` that pins one exact model. Unset applies Recommended (`recommended`) on a fresh session. |

Don't confuse these with `profiles.<name>` above: that key swaps configuration layers via `OMO_PROFILE`, while `model_profile` chooses a model within the loaded configuration. Builtin chains, session-start behavior, and override rules are in the [omo.json reference](./omo-json.md#model-profiles-native-harness).

#### Security Invariants

`mcp_env_allowlist` and `browser_automation_engine.playwright_mcp_args` are honored only from the user layer, including the user layer's own active profile block. Project layers cannot extend them.

JSONC supports `// line comments`, `/* block comments */`, and trailing commas.

Enable schema autocomplete:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/assets/omo.schema.json"
}
```

Run `bunx oh-my-openagent install` for guided setup. Run `opencode models` to list available models.

#### Migration

The first time a current harness starts (and again on install or via the CLI), a lock-and-journal migration engine imports the legacy files into the unified file:

- Sources: `oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]` in the OpenCode user config directory, in each of its `profiles/<name>/` directories, and in walked project `.opencode/` directories, plus `~/.omo/config.jsonc`.
- Targets: the legacy user file imports into `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` under `[opencode]`; each legacy profile becomes `profiles.<name>."[opencode]"` holding only the keys that differ from the user file; a project file imports into that project's `.omo/omo.jsonc`. `~/.omo/config.jsonc` imports its `[opencode]` / `[codex]` blocks, and a legacy `[omo]` block maps to `[native]`.
- OpenCode legacy files import only model/provider controls (`disabled_providers`, `model_fallback`, `models`, and `omo_agent` renamed to `sisyphus_agent`); agent and category registries, agent disable lists, hooks, and unrelated plugin settings are not imported.
- OmO Native's first start then reports, once, every OpenCode edition agent or category model choice (from the legacy files, their migration backups, or the `[opencode]` block) that Native does not use, each with the `"[native]": { ... }` member that would set it (`metis` as `plan-consultant`, `momus` as `plan-reviewer`, OpenCode provider ids as omo's) and a pointer to `omo setup`, which carries them over with your consent. It writes only the `2026-09-opencode-routing-notice` marker; `omo doctor` repeats the line while the gap exists.
- Conflict policy: no-clobber. A value already present in the target wins, and every skipped legacy value is reported as a diagnostic instead of overwriting. Prior legacy migration history is preserved under the target's `legacy_migrations` key.
- Markers: each applied migration records its id in the target's `_migrations` array, so re-runs are no-ops. `2026-07-opencode-config-unification` covers the `oh-my-*` files; `2026-07-codex-config-jsonc` covers `~/.omo/config.jsonc`; `2026-08-reasoning-unification` rewrites persisted model and reasoning fields. Codex startup runs only the second group; OpenCode plugin startup, Senpi startup, install, and the CLI run both groups, so whichever side runs first applies each group exactly once.
- Backups: sources move to `~/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC timestamp>-opencode-config/` (project sources to `<project>/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC timestamp>/`). An interrupted run resumes from its journal on the next start.
- Manual run: `oh-my-openagent config migrate`. `--dry-run` prints the transform, backup move plan, and conflicts without writing; `--json` prints machine-readable output.
- Diagnostics surface once per startup: an OpenCode toast, a Senpi `session_start` notification, or Codex loader warnings.

### Quick Start Example

Here's a practical starting `~/.omo/omo.jsonc`. OpenCode plugin settings live inside the `[opencode]` block:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/assets/omo.schema.json",

  "[opencode]": {
    "agents": {
      // Research agents: cheap fast models are fine
      "librarian": { "model": "google/gemini-3.6-flash" },
      "explore": { "model": "github-copilot/grok-code-fast-1" },

      // Plan-gated reviewers: keep the builtin prompt, pin the model
      "plan-consultant": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5", "reasoning": "max" },
      "plan-reviewer": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-astra", "reasoning": "high" },
    },

    "categories": {
      // quick - Kimi high-speed by default
      "quick": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-luna-fast", "reasoning": "low" },

      // unspecified-low - moderate tasks
      "unspecified-low": { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5-5", "reasoning": "medium" },

      // unspecified-high - complex work
      "unspecified-high": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5", "reasoning": "medium" },

      // writing - docs/prose
      "writing": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5", "reasoning": "low" },

      // visual-engineering - Fable 5.1 max, then Opus 5 max and Kimi K3 max
      "visual-engineering": {
        "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
        "reasoning": "max",
      },

      // Custom category for git operations
      "git": {
        "model": "opencode/gpt-5-nano",
        "description": "All git operations",
        "prompt_append": "Focus on atomic commits, clear messages, and safe operations.",
      },
    },

    // Limit expensive providers; let cheap ones run freely
    "background_task": {
      "providerConcurrency": {
        "anthropic": 3,
        "openai": 3,
        "opencode": 10,
        "zai-coding-plan": 10,
      },
      "modelConcurrency": {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5": 2,
        "opencode/gpt-5-nano": 20,
      },
    },

    "experimental": { "aggressive_truncation": true, "task_system": true },
    "tmux": { "enabled": false },
  },
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Agents

Override built-in agent settings. The main agent runs in your session on your session model and has no `agents` entry. Available builtin agents: `explore`, `librarian`, `plan-consultant`, `plan-reviewer`. Any other key under `agents` defines a user-defined agent.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "explore": { "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5", "temperature": 0.5 },
    "plan-reviewer": { "disable": true }
  }
}
```

> **Removed**: the retired keys `agents.metis` and `agents.momus` no longer resolve to `plan-consultant` and `plan-reviewer`. Their one-release alias window closed after 5.0.0-beta.51, so such a key now defines an ordinary custom agent under that name. Rename it to the canonical id. <!-- retired-name-allowed -->

The OpenCode edition adds `disabled_agents`, `agent_order`, and its own core-agent overrides. See [OpenCode edition configuration (legacy)](./opencode-config.md).

#### Agent Options

This table is the `[opencode].agents` surface only. Shared-base agents use the core field set (`description`, `prompt`, `model`, `models`, `reasoning`, `tools`, `execution_mode`, `background`, `max_depth`, `allowed_subagents`, `disallowed_tools`, `max_turns`, `temperature`, `disable`, and deprecated `variant` / `reasoningEffort`) documented in the [omo.json reference](./omo-json.md); OpenCode-only fields are rejected there.

#### Anthropic Extended Thinking

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": {
      "reasoning": "high",
      "providerOptions": { "thinking": { "type": "enabled", "budgetTokens": 200000 } }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Agent Permissions

Control what tools an agent can use:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "explore": {
      "permission": {
        "edit": "deny",
        "bash": "ask",
        "webfetch": "allow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Permission           | Values                                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edit`               | `ask` / `allow` / `deny`                                                    |
| `bash`               | `ask` / `allow` / `deny` or per-command: `{ "git": "allow", "rm": "deny" }` |
| `webfetch`           | `ask` / `allow` / `deny`                                                    |
| `task`               | `ask` / `allow` / `deny`                                                    |
| `doom_loop`          | `ask` / `allow` / `deny`                                                    |
| `external_directory` | `ask` / `allow` / `deny`                                                    |


#### Fallback Models with Per-Model Settings

`fallback_models` accepts either a single model string or an array. Array entries can be plain strings or objects with individual model settings:

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
      "fallback_models": [
        // Simple string fallback
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
        // Object with per-model settings
        {
          "model": "google/gemini-3.1-pro",
          "reasoning": "high",
          "temperature": 0.2
        },
        {
          "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
          "reasoning": "high"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Object entries support canonical `model`, `reasoning`, `temperature`, `top_p`, and `maxTokens`. Deprecated `variant`, `reasoningEffort`, and `thinking` remain accepted as compatibility inputs and are normalized to `reasoning` and provider options.

#### File URIs for Prompts

Both `prompt` and `prompt_append` support loading content from files via `file://` URIs. Category-level `prompt_append` supports the same URI forms.

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "librarian": {
      "prompt_append": "file:///absolute/path/to/prompt.txt"
    },
    "reviewer": {
      "prompt": "file://./relative/to/project/prompt.md"
    },
    "explore": {
      "prompt_append": "file://~/home/dir/prompt.txt"
    }
  },
  "categories": {
    "custom": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
      "prompt_append": "file://./category-context.md"
    }
  }
}
```

Paths can be absolute (`file:///abs/path`), relative to project root (`file://./rel/path`), or home-relative (`file://~/home/path`). Home-relative files are limited to `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.config/oh-my-openagent`, `~/.omo`, and `~/.opencode`. If a file URI cannot be decoded, resolved, accepted, or read, OmO inserts a warning placeholder into the prompt instead of failing hard.

### Categories

Domain-specific model delegation used by the `task()` tool. When the main agent delegates work, it picks a category, not a model name.

#### Built-in Categories

| Category             | Default Model                   | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `visual-engineering` | `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1` (max) | Visual design, UI/UX, frontend, styling, animation, design systems |
| `ultrabrain`         | `openai/gpt-6-astra` (max)      | Deep logical reasoning, complex architecture. Falls back to `gpt-5.6-sol` (max). |
| `deep-low`           | `openai/gpt-6.1-sol` (medium) | Default deep lane: 3D graphics, computer use, browser use, backend, logic, algorithms, CAPTCHA solving, multimodal, and complex research whose decisions the child can settle from evidence. Falls back to the Fast tier `gpt-6.1-sol-fast`, then `gpt-5.6-sol` (the only rung GitHub Copilot and OpenCode Zen serve), then `gpt-5.6-sol-fast`, all at medium; unavailable without a GPT-6.1 Sol or GPT-5.6 Sol tier. |
| `deep-high`          | `openai/gpt-6-astra` (xhigh)    | Escalation deep lane for a goal whose central decision cannot be settled from evidence. Single rung, no model fallback. |
| `artistry`           | `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1` (max) | Creative/unconventional approaches             |
| `quick`              | `openai/gpt-6-luna-fast` (low) | Trivial tasks, typo fixes, single-file changes |
| `unspecified-low`    | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5-5` (medium) | General tasks, low effort                      |
| `unspecified-high`   | `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5` (medium) | General tasks, high effort                     |
| `writing`            | `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5` (low)      | Documentation, prose, technical writing. Unavailable when none of its Claude models (`claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-opus-4-6`) is connected; it never falls back to another family, and the installer leaves it out. |

> **Note**: Built-in category defaults are available automatically. User-defined category config merges over the built-in defaults or adds custom categories.

#### Category Options

### Model Resolution

Runtime priority:

1. **UI-selected model** - model chosen in the OpenCode UI, for primary agents
2. **User override** - model set in config → used exactly as-is. Even on cold cache, explicit user configuration takes precedence over hardcoded fallback chains
3. **Category default** - model inherited from the assigned category config
4. **User `fallback_models`** - user-configured fallback list is tried before built-in fallback chains
5. **Provider fallback chain** - built-in provider/model chain from OmO source
6. **System default** - OpenCode's configured default model

The same resolved chain drives spawn-time selection and runtime retry fallback, so a recovered task stays on the same category chain.

In the Senpi harness, `model_profile` applies to OmO Desktop and headless sessions; the interactive TUI keeps the model it started with. An explicit `--model`, scoped model or resumed session is preserved. A fresh session otherwise uses `model_profile` as a literal pin or a named chain; unset config selects Recommended. If no candidate is available, a notice explains the unavailable profile and the current model stays. `categories.*` and `agents.*` overrides do not select the main session model, and `model_profile` does not select delegated children. See [Model Profiles](#model-profiles).

In the OpenCode plugin, every merged category appears in `availableCategories`; hiding categories with a dead fallback chain is not implemented here. That dead-chain filtering, the `model_unavailable` spawn failure, and the `task.warnings.unavailable_categories` flag belong to the Senpi/core `task` system, documented in the [omo.json reference](./omo-json.md).

#### Model Settings Compatibility

Model settings are compatibility-normalized against model capabilities instead of failing hard.

Normalized fields:

- `reasoning` - downgraded to the closest supported value, or removed if unsupported
- `temperature` - removed if unsupported by the model metadata
- `top_p` - removed if unsupported by the model metadata
- `maxTokens` - capped to the model's reported max output limit
- Provider-specific thinking options - removed if the target model does not support thinking

Deprecated `reasoningEffort` and `variant` inputs are first migrated to `reasoning`.

Examples:
- GPT-4.1 does not support reasoning, so `reasoning` is removed
- o-series models support `off` through `high`, so `xhigh` is downgraded to `high`
- GPT-5 supports `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`

Capability data comes from provider runtime metadata first. OmO also ships bundled models.dev-backed capability data, supports a refreshable local models.dev cache, and falls back to heuristic family detection plus alias rules when exact metadata is unavailable. `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor` surfaces capability diagnostics and warns when a configured model relies on compatibility fallback.


#### Agent Provider Chains

The main agent has no chain of its own: it runs on your session model (Claude Opus 5.5 or GPT 5.6 Sol recommended). The four curated agents resolve through these chains (`packages/senpi-task/src/agents/builtin/fallback-chains.ts`):

| Agent | Default Model | Provider Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **explore** | `kimi-for-coding-highspeed` | `kimi-coding\|kimi-for-coding/kimi-for-coding-highspeed (off)` → `openai\|chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-luna-fast (low)` → `deepseek/deepseek-flash (max)` → `opencode-go\|bailian-coding-plan/qwen3.7-plus` → `opencode-go/minimax-m2.7` → `anthropic\|github-copilot/claude-haiku-4-5`

#### Category Provider Chains

This table mirrors the authoritative hardcoded category fallback chains: the chain's primary rung and its remaining provider priority. The built-in chains list no `vercel` or `quotio-openai` rungs; Vercel AI Gateway stays a manual provider choice.

## Task System

### Background Tasks

Control parallel agent execution and concurrency limits. `background_task` (camelCase) is the OpenCode plugin key; the shared/Senpi/Codex equivalent is the core `task` object (snake_case: `default_concurrency`, `provider_concurrency`, `model_concurrency`, `max_depth`, `ttl_ms`). They are separate objects, not aliases; `background_task` at the shared base fails core validation. Setting a concurrency value to `0` means unlimited (no cap) in both places: `background_task` (`defaultConcurrency`, `providerConcurrency`, `modelConcurrency`) and the core `task` object.

```json
{
  "background_task": {
    "defaultConcurrency": 5,
    "staleTimeoutMs": 2700000,
    "providerConcurrency": { "anthropic": 3, "openai": 5, "google": 10 },
    "modelConcurrency": { "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5": 2 }
  }
}
```

| `circuitBreaker`            | -         | Circuit-breaker object: `enabled` (default `true`), `maxToolCalls`, `consecutiveThreshold` |

## Features

### Skills

Skills bring domain-specific expertise and embedded MCPs.

Selected built-in skills: `playwright`, `playwright-cli`, `dev-browser`, `git-master`, `frontend`, `review-work`, `remove-ai-slops`, `init-deep`, `debugging`, `security-research`, `security-review`, `visual-qa`, `team-mode`. The `team-mode` skill is only rendered when `team_mode.enabled` is true.

Disable built-in skills: `{ "disabled_skills": ["playwright"] }`. `disabled_skills` is also a shared base key of `~/.omo/omo.jsonc`, honored by every harness including OmO Native (for example `{ "disabled_skills": ["frontend", "visual-qa"] }`); user and project layers are unioned. `skills.enable` below only filters config-sourced skills, not builtin, native, or bundled ones - use `disabled_skills` to hide those.

#### Skills Configuration

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "sources": [
      { "path": "./my-skills", "recursive": true },
      "https://example.com/skill.yaml"
    ],
    "enable": ["my-skill"],
    "disable": ["other-skill"],
    "my-skill": {
      "description": "What it does",
      "template": "Custom prompt template",
      "from": "source-file.ts",
      "model": "custom/model",
      "agent": "custom-agent",
      "subtask": true,
      "argument-hint": "usage hint",

      "compatibility": ">= 3.0.0",
      "metadata": { "author": "Your Name" },
      "allowed-tools": ["read", "bash"]
    }
  }
}
```

| `sources` option | Default | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `path`           | -       | Local path or remote URL        |
| `recursive`      | `false` | Recurse into subdirectories     |
| `glob`           | -       | Glob pattern for file selection |

### Memory

Persistent, per-agent memory stored as a git repository. Memory is on by default and learns
actively: it reflects on its own, nudges when durable facts go unsaved, recalls a stored memory
mid-session when it would change the next step, extracts facts in the background, consolidates
during a dream pass, and keeps records about people.

Configured under `memory` in `omo.json`, with per-agent overrides under `memory.agents.<name>`.

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "agent": "auto",
    "reflection": { "trigger": { "step_count": 25 } },
    "nudge": { "every_user_turns": 10 },
    "dream": { "idle_minutes": 30 },
    "agents": {
      "reviewer": { "dream": { "enabled": false } }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option               | Default    | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`            | `true`     | Master switch for the whole memory component                                     |
| `agent`              | `"auto"`   | Which agent identity owns the memory repository                                  |
| `compile_warn_tokens`| `30000`    | Warn when the compiled memory block exceeds this many tokens                     |
| `agents`             | `{}`       | Per-agent overrides; any block below may be overridden field by field            |

#### Reflection

Reflection reviews the conversation and writes durable notes back into memory. An automatic run
that fails (step-count or compaction trigger) is not retried on the very next trigger: the
conversation backs off for 5 seconds, doubling per consecutive failure up to 5 minutes, and a
successful reflection clears the backoff. `/reflect` ignores it, so you can always force a run.

| Option                     | Default  | Description                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reflection.enabled`       | `true`   | Turn reflection off without disabling the rest of memory   |
| `reflection.trigger.step_count`   | `25` | Reflect every N steps; `0` disables the step trigger   |
| `reflection.trigger.on_compaction`| `true` | Also reflect when the context is compacted            |
| `reflection.merge`         | `"auto"` | `auto` or `integration` merge strategy                     |
| `reflection.category`      | `"quick"`| Task executor category for the reflection child            |
| `reflection.timeout_minutes`| `15`    | Hard timeout for a reflection run                          |
| `reflection.sandbox`       | `"auto"` | `auto`, `required`, or `off`                               |

#### Nudge

Reminds the agent to save when durable facts have gone unwritten.

| Option                    | Default | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `nudge.enabled`           | `true`  | Emit the nudge line in the memory metadata block      |
| `nudge.every_user_turns`  | `10`    | Nudge after this many user turns without a save       |

#### Recall (recollections)

The nudge above asks the agent to write. Recall is the other direction: a read-only judge called
Kibitzer runs as one resident sidecar session per main agent session. It is fed the session's
prompts, tool calls and tool results as bounded, redacted events, and hands back a hint only when
a stored memory would change the next step (a constraint being ignored, a past failure of the same
approach, an answer about to be re-derived). Silence is the default. Most turns produce nothing,
and a sidecar that finds nothing leaves no trace.

The sidecar only spends a model turn (a "wake") when a prompt or tool call surfaces a memory
candidate it has not judged yet in its lifetime; unchanged candidates never wake it. Wakes are
admitted through a lease held as lock files under the memory identity's runtime directory, shared
by every omo process on the machine that uses that memory, so at most `max_concurrent_wakes` run
at once - a session that finds every slot busy keeps buffering events and tries again at its next
hook. Inside a wake the sidecar has exactly five read-only tools:
`read` and `grep` over the workspace, `session_entries` over the parent transcript, `memory` with
`search` and `read` only, and `nudge`. It has no tool that writes memory or files, no shell, and
each wake is limited to `tool_budget` tool calls and 90 seconds. When its own context passes 60%
of `sidecar_max_tokens` it is replaced by a fresh sidecar seeded with what it already delivered
or rejected, so a long session never runs the judge out of context. A sidecar whose model fails
is disposed and recreated after an exponential backoff (1 s doubling to 5 min); nothing it had
buffered is lost. When no provider serving the `recall.category` chain is connected at all, that
is a configuration state, not a failure: the session gets one warning notice naming the category
and its unconnected providers - run `/login <provider>` to connect one, or pin
`categories.<name>.model` (or `recall.category`) in `omo.json` to a connected model - and judging
resumes by itself once a chain provider connects.

When it does fire, you see a recollection in the transcript identified as Kibitzer advice: a
single fixed `Kibitzer` title, then `recalled memory: <hint>`,
with the memory path beneath it. It's a transcript entry, not a
toast. The hint is one sentence of at most 200 characters, and the same memory surfaces at most
once per session. Treat it as a hint, not current state: the agent is told to verify before
relying on it, and expanding the entry shows that caveat.

| Option              | Default | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recall.enabled`    | `true`  | Run the Kibitzer sidecar and surface recollections; `false` is the only off switch |
| `recall.max_items`  | `2`     | Most memories one wake may surface (1-5)                        |
| `recall.category` | `quick` | Model category the sidecar runs on (it never leaves that category's chain) |
| `recall.event_caps` | `tool_args: 400`, `result_head: 600`, `assistant: 1500`, `prompt: 4000` | Per-event character caps, applied after secret redaction |
| `recall.sidecar_max_tokens` | `48000` | Sidecar context budget; the sidecar reseeds itself at 60% of it |
| `recall.max_concurrent_wakes` | `2` | Machine-wide cap on wakes running at once |
| `recall.tool_budget` | `8` | Read-only tool calls one wake may make before it is cut off |

Like the other memory blocks, every recall option can be overridden per agent under
`memory.agents.<name>.recall`; `event_caps` merges field by field.

How candidate memories are picked before the sidecar judges them is not a setting. Recall picks
it from the terms it plans from the conversation and from your memory repository: English terms over
an English memory of fewer than 200 notes match every query word verbatim, as before. When a planned
term contains Korean, Chinese or Japanese text, or at least a tenth of the letters in your notes are,
candidates are scored by word rarity with the text split into two-character pieces, so `퍼블리시할`
still finds a note about `퍼블리시`. The planned terms include terms taken from tool arguments and
are not the raw message, so the switch goes both ways: a Korean word the planner does not keep leaves
a mostly English message on verbatim matching, and a Korean file path in a tool argument such as
`docs/배포-절차.md` switches the selection to word rarity. From 200 notes on, both are combined so a
memory either one finds can still reach the sidecar, which decides what is worth a nudge, and the
note that matches an English phrase from the conversation word for word keeps first place. Word
rarity treats common English endings as one word, so `rollback` still finds a note that says
`rollbacks`.

#### Facts

Background extraction of durable facts from settled turns.

| `facts.enabled`           | `true`  | Run background fact extraction                            |
| `facts.debounce_settles`  | `4`     | Settled turns to accumulate before extracting             |

#### Dream

A consolidation pass that reorganizes memory, audits skill usage, and updates people records.
It runs opportunistically when the session goes idle, and optionally at shutdown.

| Option                        | Default  | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dream.enabled`               | `true`   | Enable the dream pass                                         |
| `dream.idle_minutes`          | `30`     | Idle minutes before a dream may start; `0` disables the trigger|
| `dream.min_hours_between`     | `24`     | Minimum hours between two dream runs                          |
| `dream.shutdown_launch`       | `true`   | Allow a dream to be launched at shutdown                      |
| `dream.auto_select_max`       | `5`      | Conversations `--auto` may select (1-10)                      |
| `dream.auto_select_max_chars` | `150000` | Byte budget for auto-selected conversations                   |

#### People

Records about individuals, stored as cards with an observation ledger.

| Option                    | Default | Description                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `people.enabled`          | `true`  | Maintain people records                            |
| `people.max_entries`      | `40`    | Maximum observation entries per person (1-100)     |
| `people.max_entry_chars`  | `200`   | Maximum characters per entry (50-500)              |

#### Soul

| Option             | Default | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `soul.edit_notice` | `true`  | Surface a notice when the persona, identity, or boundaries block changes |

#### Write Notice

| Option                  | Default | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `write_notice.enabled`  | `true`  | Render memory writes as a notice row instead of the plain commit line |

#### Sync and Search

| Option           | Default | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sync.enabled`   | `true`  | Sync the memory repository                      |
| `sync.remote`    | -       | Optional git remote for the memory repository   |
| `search.enabled` | `true`  | Enable memory search                            |

In Senpi, run `/sleeptime` to see every resolved memory value, including which ones a per-agent
override changed. OpenCode has no `/sleeptime` command; inspect the `memory` block in `omo.jsonc` instead.

### Hooks

Disable built-in hooks via `disabled_hooks`:

```json
{ "disabled_hooks": ["comment-checker"] }
```

Available hooks: `todo-continuation-enforcer`, `session-notification`, `comment-checker`, `tool-output-truncator`, `question-label-truncator`, `directory-agents-injector`, `directory-readme-injector`, `empty-task-response-detector`, `think-mode`, `model-fallback`, `anthropic-context-window-limit-recovery`, `preemptive-compaction`, `rules-injector`, `background-notification`, `auto-update-checker`, `ast-grep-sg-provision`, `startup-toast`, `keyword-detector`, `agent-usage-reminder`, `non-interactive-env`, `interactive-bash-session`, `tool-pair-validator`, `monitor-status-injector`, `goal`, `category-skill-reminder`, `compaction-context-injector`, `compaction-todo-preserver`, `claude-code-hooks`, `auto-slash-command`, `edit-error-recovery`, `json-error-recovery`, `delegate-task-retry`, `team-tool-gating`, `ulw-execute`, `unstable-agent-babysitter`, `task-resume-info`, `stop-continuation-guard`, `tasks-todowrite-disabler`, `runtime-fallback`, `write-existing-file-guard`, `notepad-write-guard`, `bash-file-read-guard`, `hashline-read-enhancer`, `read-image-resizer`, `todo-description-override`, `webfetch-redirect-guard`, `fsync-skip-warning`, `plan-format-validator`, `legacy-plugin-toast`

Hooks that exist only in the OpenCode edition are listed on the legacy page linked from [Agents](#agents).

Guard hooks such as `team-tool-gating`, `write-existing-file-guard`, `bash-file-read-guard`, `webfetch-redirect-guard`, `rules-injector`, and `tool-pair-validator` protect safety, permissions, or provider protocol correctness. Disable them only for audited local debugging in a trusted environment.

**Notes:**

- `directory-agents-injector` - auto-disabled on OpenCode 1.1.37+ (native AGENTS.md support)
- `startup-toast` is a sub-feature of `auto-update-checker`. Disable just the toast by adding `startup-toast` to `disabled_hooks`.

### Commands

Disable built-in commands via `disabled_commands`:

```json
{ "disabled_commands": ["refactor", "ulw-execute"] }
```

Available commands: `goal`, `refactor`, `ulw-execute`, `stop-continuation`, `remove-ai-slops`, `handoff`, `hyperplan`. The `disabled_commands` option currently accepts only the schema enum, which does not include `handoff`.

### Browser Automation

`browser_automation_engine.provider` accepts only the three values below.
Unsupported values fail schema validation and `oh-my-opencode doctor` reports
both the rejected value and the replacement: use the built-in browser path:
Bun.WebView / playwright-core scripts. Remove the obsolete provider override
from the active `[opencode]` block in `omo.jsonc` (including project/profile
layers); it is not silently mapped to another provider.

| Provider               | Interface | Installation                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `playwright` (default) | MCP tools | Auto-installed via npx                              |
| `dev-browser`          | Skill     | Uses persistent dev-browser state                   |
| `playwright-cli`       | Bash CLI  | Uses the token-efficient `@playwright/cli`           |

Browser skills use two tiers from js eval: `new Bun.WebView()` on Bun >= 1.4
(macOS default; Linux/Windows require installed Chrome/Chromium/Edge), otherwise
write and run a `playwright-core` script against local Chrome (`channel: "chrome"`).
Use the script tier for Chrome semantics, stealth, traces, and authenticated
profiles; `launchPersistentContext` receives a CLONED profile, never the live one.
Codex uses `browser:control-in-app-browser` for ordinary page control. These are
skill execution paths, not new values of `browser_automation_engine.provider`.

### Tmux Integration

Run background subagents in separate tmux panes. Requires running inside tmux with `opencode --port <port>`.

```json
{
  "tmux": {
    "enabled": true,
    "layout": "main-vertical",
    "main_pane_size": 60,
    "main_pane_min_width": 120,
    "agent_pane_min_width": 40,
    "isolation": "inline"
  }
}
```

| Option                 | Default         | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`              | `false`         | Enable tmux pane spawning                                                           |
| `layout`               | `main-vertical` | `main-vertical` / `main-horizontal` / `tiled` / `even-horizontal` / `even-vertical` |
| `main_pane_size`       | `60`            | Main pane % (20–80)                                                                 |
| `main_pane_min_width`  | `120`           | Min main pane columns                                                               |
| `agent_pane_min_width` | `40`            | Min agent pane columns                                                              |
| `isolation`            | `inline`        | `inline` / `window` / `session`                                                     |

### Git Master

Configure git commit behavior:

```json
{ "git_master": { "commit_footer": false, "git_env_prefix": "GIT_MASTER=1" } }
```

`commit_footer` (default `false`) opts in to an "Ultraworked with Sisyphus" footer in the commit body; a string replaces the builtin text. Commits keep your own git author and committer, and omo never adds a `Co-authored-by` trailer; `include_co_authored_by` is a deprecated no-op kept so existing configs still validate.

This key configures the OpenCode plugin inside `[opencode]`. The Senpi harness reads the typed shared `git_master` section instead, documented in the [omo.json reference](./omo-json.md#git_master-native-harness).

`git_env_prefix` (default `"GIT_MASTER=1"`) is prepended to git commands; set it to `""` to disable.

### Comment Checker

Customize the comment quality checker:

```json
{
  "comment_checker": {
    "custom_prompt": "Your message. Use {{comments}} placeholder."
  }
}
```

### Notification

Force-enable session notifications:

```json
{ "notification": { "force_enable": true } }
```

`force_enable` (`false`) - force session-notification even if external notification plugins are detected.

OpenCode also has native TUI Attention notifications in `tui.json`. Use either native Attention or OmO `session-notification` for the same events, not both, or you may receive duplicate desktop notifications. OmO auto-disables `session-notification` when it detects known external notification plugins such as `opencode-notifier`, but native Attention is OpenCode TUI config rather than a plugin entry, so OmO cannot detect it through the plugin list. Keep `session-notification` enabled when you want OmO's richer idle notification body with session title and recent message context; otherwise prefer native Attention for basic TUI notification and sound events.

### MCPs

Built-in MCPs (enabled by default): `websearch` (Exa AI), `context7` (library docs), `grep_app` (GitHub code search), and `lsp` (local language-server tools). Structural search and rewrite is provided by the `ast-grep` skill instead of a built-in MCP.

```json
{ "disabled_mcps": ["websearch", "context7", "grep_app", "lsp"] }
```

### LSP

LSP tools are served by the built-in `lsp` MCP server (see [MCPs](#mcps)). The
previous top-level `"lsp"` block in the plugin config is no longer read; the
unified config migration strips it when importing a legacy file.

To configure custom language servers, create `.opencode/lsp.json`, `.omo/lsp.json`, or `.omo/lsp-client.json` at the project root. The MCP server launches with `LSP_TOOLS_MCP_PROJECT_CONFIG` set to a platform-delimiter-separated search list of those three paths and reads the first applicable server maps. The schema lives in the
`packages/lsp-tools-mcp` vendored package (upstream:
[code-yeongyu/lsp-tools-mcp](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lsp-tools-mcp)).

To disable the LSP MCP entirely:

```json
{ "disabled_mcps": ["lsp"] }
```

Process hygiene is unconditional and has no config keys: a parent-liveness watchdog exits MCP server processes when their parent dies, a newly started lsp daemon reaps older-version daemons at startup, and a best-effort family sweep removes orphaned lsp processes at startup on every adapter (OpenCode plugin startup, the Codex `SessionStart` hook, and Senpi session start).

## Advanced

### Runtime Fallback

Auto-switches to backup models on API errors.

**Simple configuration** (enable/disable with defaults):

```json
{ "runtime_fallback": true }
```

```json
{ "runtime_fallback": false }
```

**Advanced configuration** (full control):

```json
{
  "runtime_fallback": {
    "enabled": true,
    "retry_on_errors": [429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
    "max_fallback_attempts": 3,
    "cooldown_seconds": 60,
    "timeout_seconds": 30,
    "notify_on_fallback": true
  }
}
```

| Option                  | Default             | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`               | `false`             | Enable runtime fallback                                                                                                        |
| `retry_on_errors`       | `[429,500,502,503,504]` | HTTP codes that trigger fallback. Also handles classified provider key errors.                                              |
| `max_fallback_attempts` | `3`                 | Max fallback attempts per session (1–20)                                                                                       |
| `cooldown_seconds`      | `60`                | Seconds before retrying a failed model                                                                                         |
| `timeout_seconds`       | `30`                | Seconds before forcing next fallback. **Set to `0` to disable timeout-based escalation and `message.updated` provider retry signal detection.** Structured `session.status` retry events can still trigger fallback. |
| `notify_on_fallback`    | `true`              | Toast notification on model switch                                                                                             |
| `restore_primary_after_cooldown` | `false` | Return to the primary model after its cooldown expires                                                                       |

#### Speeding Up Fallback (Proxy APIs)

If you are using a proxy API provider, they may return different error codes (e.g., `401`, `403`, `404`) for quota exhaustion or model unavailability. To make fallback trigger instantly without waiting for long timeouts:

```jsonc
{
  "runtime_fallback": {
    "enabled": true,
    // Add your proxy's specific error codes to retry_on_errors
    "retry_on_errors": [400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
    "max_fallback_attempts": 3,
    "cooldown_seconds": 15, // Shorter cooldown
    "timeout_seconds": 10   // Detect hung proxy requests faster
  }
}
```

Define `fallback_models` per agent or category:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
      "fallback_models": [
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
        {
          "model": "google/gemini-3.1-pro",
          "reasoning": "high"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`fallback_models` also supports object-style entries so you can attach settings to a specific fallback model:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
      "fallback_models": [
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
        {
          "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
          "reasoning": "high"
        },
        {
          "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
          "reasoning": "high",
          "temperature": 0.2,
          "top_p": 0.95,
          "maxTokens": 8192
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Mixed arrays are allowed, so string entries and object entries can appear together in the same fallback chain.

#### Object-style `fallback_models`

Object entries use the following shape:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `model` | string | Fallback model ID. Provider prefix is optional when OmO can inherit the current/default provider. |
| `reasoning` | string | Canonical reasoning override for this fallback entry. |
| `temperature` | number | Temperature applied if this fallback model becomes active. |
| `top_p` | number | Top-p applied if this fallback model becomes active. |
| `maxTokens` | number | Max response tokens applied if this fallback model becomes active. |
| `variant` | string | Deprecated compatibility input normalized to `reasoning`. |
| `reasoningEffort` | string | Deprecated compatibility input normalized to `reasoning`. |
| `thinking` | object | Legacy form normalized to `reasoning` plus `provider_options.thinking` in the unified shape. |

Per-model settings are **fallback-only**. They are promoted only when that specific fallback model is actually selected, so they do not override your primary model settings when the primary model resolves successfully.

`thinking` uses the same shape as the normal agent/category option:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `type` | string | `enabled` or `disabled` |
| `budgetTokens` | number | Optional Anthropic thinking budget |

Object entries can also omit the provider prefix when OmO can infer it from the current/default provider. Canonical `reasoning` takes precedence over deprecated `reasoningEffort`, which takes precedence over deprecated `variant`; an inline model suffix is normalized separately.

#### Full examples

**1. Simple string chain**

Use strings when you only need an ordered fallback chain:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "reviewer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
      "fallback_models": [
        "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
        "google/gemini-3.1-pro"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Same-provider shorthand**

If the primary model already establishes the provider, fallback entries can omit the prefix:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "reviewer": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
      "fallback_models": [
        "gpt-6-luna-fast",
        {
          "model": "gpt-5.6-sol",
          "reasoning": "medium",
          "maxTokens": 4096
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example OmO treats `gpt-6-luna-fast` and `gpt-5.6-sol` as OpenAI fallback entries because the current/default provider is already `openai`.

**3. Mixed cross-provider chain**

Mix string entries and object entries when only some fallback models need special settings:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
      "fallback_models": [
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
        {
          "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
          "reasoning": "high"
        },
        {
          "model": "google/gemini-3.1-pro",
          "reasoning": "high"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Category-level fallback chain**

`fallback_models` works the same way under `categories`:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "deep-low": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
      "fallback_models": [
        {
          "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
          "reasoning": "xhigh",
          "maxTokens": 12000
        },
        {
          "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
          "reasoning": "max",
          "temperature": 0.2
        },
        "google/gemini-3.1-pro(high)"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**5. Full object entry with every supported field**

This shows every supported object-style parameter in one place:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-reviewer": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
      "fallback_models": [
        {
          "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol(low)",
          "reasoning": "high",
          "temperature": 0.3,
          "top_p": 0.9,
          "maxTokens": 8192
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example the explicit `"reasoning": "high"` is canonical; deprecated fields are resolved with precedence `reasoning` > `reasoningEffort` > `variant`, while the inline `(low)` suffix is normalized separately.

This final example is a **complete canonical shape reference** for `[opencode]` fallback objects. Prefer unified `reasoning` for model tuning, and use provider-specific `[opencode]` fields only when the target model requires them.

### Model Capabilities

OmO can refresh a local models.dev capability snapshot on startup. This cache is controlled by `model_capabilities`.

```jsonc
{
  "model_capabilities": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto_refresh_on_start": true,
    "refresh_timeout_ms": 5000,
    "source_url": "https://models.dev/api.json"
  }
}
```

| Option | Default behavior | Description |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `enabled` | enabled unless explicitly set to `false` | Master switch for model capability refresh behavior |
| `auto_refresh_on_start` | refresh on startup unless explicitly set to `false` | Refresh the local models.dev cache during startup checks |
| `refresh_timeout_ms` | `5000` | Timeout for the startup refresh attempt |
| `source_url` | `https://models.dev/api.json` | Override the models.dev source URL |

Notes:

- Startup refresh runs through the auto-update checker hook.
- Manual refresh is available via `bunx oh-my-openagent refresh-model-capabilities`.
- Provider runtime metadata still takes priority when OmO resolves capabilities for compatibility checks.

### Hashline Edit

Replaces the built-in `Edit` tool with a hash-anchored version using `LINE#ID` references to prevent stale-line edits. Disabled by default.

```json
{ "hashline_edit": true }
```

When enabled, OmO registers the hash-anchored `edit` tool and activates the `hashline-read-enhancer` companion hook, which annotates Read output with `LINE#ID` markers. Opt in by setting `hashline_edit: true`. Disable the companion hook via `disabled_hooks` if needed.

### Telemetry

Two distinct keys exist. The `[opencode]` block takes a boolean:

```jsonc
{
  "[opencode]": { "telemetry": false }
}
```

The shared base and Senpi use an object:

```jsonc
{
  "telemetry": { "enabled": false }
}
```

| Option      | Default | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[opencode].telemetry` | `true` (enabled when omitted) | Enable anonymous daily-active telemetry for the OpenCode plugin. Set to `false` to disable it. |
| `telemetry.enabled` (shared base) | `true` | Object form used by the shared base and Senpi. A bare boolean at the shared base fails validation. |

### Environment Variables

| Variable              | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` | Override OpenCode config directory (useful for profile isolation) |
| `OPENGATEWAY_API_KEY` | API key for the OpenGateway provider; without this or an `opengateway` auth entry, the plugin does not inject the provider |
| `OMO_DEBUG` | Set to `1` (any non-empty value) to print omo-senpi component `info` diagnostics on stderr. Unset, those lines are silent. `warn` and `error` still print. Component logs never go to stdout. |
| `OMO_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` | Set to `0`, `false`, or `no` to disable anonymous telemetry |
| `OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG` | Legacy telemetry opt-out flag. Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to disable PostHog |
| `OMO_CODEX_DISABLE_POSTHOG` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to disable PostHog telemetry for the `omo-codex` adapter. Global `OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG` also disables Codex telemetry. |
| `OMO_CODEX_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` | Set to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `yes` to disable anonymous telemetry for `omo-codex` |
| `OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH` | Native Windows Codex installs only. Absolute path to Git Bash, for example `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`, when `where bash` cannot find it |
| `LAZYCODEX_CONFIG_MIGRATION_DISABLED` | Set to `1` to skip the Codex config migration that runs on every session start (including the `multi_agent_v2` force-disable and managed reasoning-profile sync), leaving `config.toml` untouched |
| `OMO_CODEX_CONFIG_MIGRATION_DISABLED` | Alias of `LAZYCODEX_CONFIG_MIGRATION_DISABLED` |
| `LSP_TOOLS_MCP_INSTALL_DECISIONS` | Override the LSP install-decisions path. Codex defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/lsp-install-decisions.json`; OpenCode injects its OpenCode config-directory path. |
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Optional override for the built-in PostHog project API key |
| `POSTHOG_HOST` | Override the PostHog ingestion host. Defaults to `https://us.i.posthog.com` |

### LSP Install Decisions

When an LSP tool hits a language server that is not installed, it asks once per server and persists the answer to a harness-specific file: Codex uses `$CODEX_HOME/lsp-install-decisions.json`, while OpenCode injects `lsp-install-decisions.json` under its OpenCode config directory. Override either path with `LSP_TOOLS_MCP_INSTALL_DECISIONS`. A `declined` entry collapses all future diagnostics for that server to a one-line note. To get prompted again - or to re-enable a server that an agent declined on your behalf - delete the file or the server's entry in it.

### Codex Light Git Bash MCP

Native Windows Codex installs bundle a `git_bash` MCP server and write `[plugins."omo@sisyphuslabs".mcp_servers.git_bash] enabled = true`. Non-Windows installs keep the bundled manifest entry but write `enabled = false`, so the plugin detail can still show the server while policy prevents exposure.

The installer discovers Git Bash with `OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH`, standard Git for Windows locations, and PATH. If discovery fails, it prints manual install guidance and stops without running `winget` or changing system dependencies. The Light plugin also emits a fixed reminder before the first Codex shell-like `Bash` hook call in a Windows session, and resets that reminder after `PostCompact` so the first post-compaction shell call recommends `git_bash` again.

### Codex Companion Plugin Compatibility

LazyCodex can coexist with other Codex plugins, but if LazyCodex is your primary Codex workflow the `codex@openai-codex` companion plugin adds its own `SessionStart` and `Stop` lifecycle hooks. Those extra hooks can produce confusing Codex hook-failure banners even when the LazyCodex hooks are healthy.

`lazycodex doctor` warns when `omo@sisyphuslabs` is enabled and the companion plugin is enabled, or when stale `[hooks.state."codex@openai-codex:..."]` SessionStart/Stop trust entries remain in `~/.codex/config.toml`. The doctor only reports this condition; it does not disable or delete another plugin for you.

If LazyCodex is the primary workflow, disable the companion plugin explicitly:

```toml
[plugins."codex@openai-codex"]
enabled = false
```

If doctor still warns afterward, remove the stale `[hooks.state."codex@openai-codex:..."]` SessionStart/Stop entries from the Codex config after making your own backup.

### Provider-Specific

#### Google Auth

Install [`opencode-antigravity-auth`](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth) for Google Gemini. Provides multi-account load balancing, dual quota, and variant-based thinking.

##### Split Claude Routing

Provider path can change Claude context limits. Confirm the active model's context window with `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor --verbose` rather than assuming 200k vs 1M.

Use Antigravity for cheaper or quota-balanced work. Use direct Anthropic for long-context planning, review, and research sessions when the account, model, and required beta/header setup support a larger window.

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    // Google Antigravity Claude.
    "explore": {
      "model": "google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-6"
    },
    "librarian": {
      "model": "google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-6"
    },

    // Direct Anthropic, only for eligible long-context accounts/models.
    "plan-consultant": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5",
      "reasoning": "max"
    },
    "plan-reviewer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5"
    }
  }
}
```

If you see an error like `prompt is too long ... > 200000`, check whether the
agent is routed through `google/antigravity-*`. Move that agent to a direct
`anthropic/*` model only when the account, model, and required beta/header setup
support a larger context window. Keep the Antigravity path explicit when you want
that provider's quota and routing behavior.

#### Ollama

**Must** disable streaming to avoid JSON parse errors:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "explore": { "model": "ollama/qwen3-coder" }
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `stream` option should be configured in your OpenCode settings or via environment variables, not in the agent config. See [Ollama Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/ollama.md) for details on disabling streaming.

Common models: `ollama/qwen3-coder`, `ollama/ministral-3:14b`, `ollama/lfm2.5-thinking`

See [Ollama Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/ollama.md) for `JSON Parse error: Unexpected EOF` issues.

#### OpenGateway

The `omo-opencode` plugin exposes the OpenAI-compatible `opengateway` provider at `https://apis.opengateway.ai/v1` when `OPENGATEWAY_API_KEY` is set or an `opengateway` auth entry exists. No provider is injected if neither credential is present.
