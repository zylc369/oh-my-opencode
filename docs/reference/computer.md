# The `computer` tool

The OmO Native computer-use component registers a search-exposed `computer` tool and, after activation, a `computer` global in JavaScript and Python eval kernels. For setup, stop paths, platform limits and permissions, see [Computer use](../guide/computer-use.md).

> **Experimental.** Computer use is experimental support. The tool contract below may change between releases.

## Source of the contract

- Component registration, session lifecycle and resource discovery: `packages/omo-senpi/src/components/computer-use/index.ts`
- Typed native-only configuration: `packages/omo-config-core/src/schema/computer.ts`
- Tool actions and validation: `packages/senpi-desktop-tool/src/tool.ts`, `packages/senpi-desktop-tool/src/params.ts`
- User command and permission tiers: `packages/senpi-desktop-tool/src/command.ts`, `packages/senpi-desktop-tool/src/permission.ts`
- Eval facade and model-facing guidance: `packages/senpi-desktop-prelude/src/prelude.js`, `packages/senpi-desktop-prelude/src/prelude.py`
- Engine client and protocol: `packages/senpi-desktop-service/src`, `packages/senpi-desktop-protocol/src`
- Engine and platform backends: `crates/senpi-desktop-engine`, `crates/senpi-desktop-backend-macos`, `crates/senpi-desktop-backend-x11`, `crates/senpi-desktop-backend-wayland`, `crates/senpi-desktop-backend-win32`

## Actions

| `action` | Parameters | Result |
|----------|------------|--------|
| `call` | `chain`: a desktop helper `{ method, args? }`, optionally followed by one window or element method | The helper's result; a screenshot also returns image content |
| `run` | `code`: JavaScript async function body with `desktop`, `wait`, `assert` and `tool`; optional `read_only` and `timeout` in seconds | The returned value and displays |
| `capabilities` | None | Backend, capture/input/AX permissions, stop path and focus guard |
| `close` | None | Ends the desktop session |

For example, `{ "action": "call", "chain": [{ "method": "screenshot" }] }` captures the desktop. A `run` can call `await desktop.screenshot()` then `await desktop.click(x, y)` using a coordinate from that frame. Screenshots are limited to a coordinate-safe size when passed to a model; a stale frame is rejected with `InvalidCoordinateFrame`.

The `computer` eval global offers the same operations as a fluent facade. A `run` marked `read_only: true` is constrained by the runtime, so attempted input fails rather than escaping the read tier.

## Permission classification

`capabilities`, inspection-only `call` chains, and `run` with `read_only: true` use `computer:read`. `close`, other calls and runs, unknown methods and malformed inputs use `computer:exec`. The host checks the tier before the engine receives an action, so an exec-denied click is not audited as an engine click. Rules may target the entire `computer` tool or the `computer:read` and `computer:exec` tiers. An approval for read never approves exec.

## Coordinates and delivery

Pointer coordinates refer to the latest screenshot of the same target, while accessibility coordinates are global desktop coordinates. Each accessibility snapshot changes the reference generation; old refs fail with `StaleRef`.

Scroll amounts (`dx`/`dy` of `scroll`, and `scroll_x`/`scroll_y` of `computer_actions`) are pixels, the same unit on every OS. macOS posts them as pixel scroll events; Windows and X11 send one wheel notch per 40 px (rounded, at least one), and Wayland sends 120ths of a notch at the same rate. So `dy: 120` scrolls about three notches everywhere. A positive `dy` moves the view toward the end of the content and a positive `dx` toward its right edge, whatever the natural-scrolling setting.

Input defaults to background delivery when supported. On macOS it leaves the frontmost app, its focused window, the cursor and the destination of the user's next keystroke unchanged, but a clicked target window may rise directly under the user's front window. Foreground delivery uses a focus guard to restore the previous window and cursor; restoration failures are reported instead of hidden. A stop chord, screen lock, lost stop path or missing OS permission refuses input before a backend action.

## Error codes

A failed call carries one engine error code (`crates/senpi-desktop-core/src/error.rs`). The ones a user or model acts on:

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|------|---------|------------|
| `PermissionDenied` | The OS permission for capture, input or accessibility is missing | Grant it to the app that launches OmO; see [Set up your operating system](../guide/computer-use.md#set-up-your-operating-system) |
| `Suspended` | The user pressed the stop chord or ran `/computer stop` | Stop acting; only the user runs `/computer resume` |
| `StopPathUnavailable` | The global stop chord could not be armed, so input is refused | Use a host where the chord arms, or `allow_host_relay_only_stop` |
| `ScreenLocked` | The screen is locked | Unlock the session |
| `BackgroundUnavailable` | The target refuses background delivery | Use accessibility actions or `delivery: "foreground"` |
| `InvalidCoordinateFrame` | The coordinates do not belong to the latest screenshot of that target, or the target moved or resized | Take a new screenshot of the same target |
| `StaleRef` | An accessibility ref from an older snapshot | Take a new `ax()` snapshot |
| `WindowNotFound`, `InvalidTarget` | The window closed, or the filter matched nothing or several windows | List windows again and pick one |
| `AxUnsupported`, `AxFailed` | The element or platform does not support that accessibility operation | Fall back to pointer input |
| `FocusRestoreFailed`, `CursorRestoreFailed` | Foreground delivery could not put the previous window or cursor back | Tell the user; nothing is hidden |
| `CaptureFailed`, `InputFailed`, `Timeout`, `Cancelled`, `Closed`, `TransactionFailed`, `Internal` | The platform call failed, took too long, was aborted, or the session ended | Observe again before retrying; stop after repeated failures |

Engine start failures are reported by `/computer status` as `engine: native-unavailable`, `quarantined` or `abi-mismatch`, and are described in [Troubleshooting](../guide/computer-use.md#troubleshooting).

## Engine interoperability

Engine discovery checks `computer.engine_path`, a compiled sidecar, the package prebuild and `target/release` in that order (`packages/senpi-desktop-engine/src/locator.ts`). Outside OmO Native, `senpi-desktop-engine --mcp` serves the same engine operations over MCP stdio, forwarding through the daemon and preserving its stop-path and audit checks. A host using relay-only stop must keep the heartbeat alive; the model cannot invoke the user-only resume operation.
