# OmO Web — Design System v3 ("Phosphor Ledger", spoken plainly)

> **v3 delta (2026-09-13).** The v2 visual system below (ink + phosphor, cyan = live, hairlines, 0px panels, no motion library) stays in force. v3 changes the **voice** and the **reader**: the site now speaks to someone who is interested in tech, not fluent in it. Copy is benefit-first ("Your tool for real work. But it's an agent."), jargon lives behind a scroll-revealed "still curious?" fold, chapter numerals and host/edition tabs are gone, one install command ships everywhere, and Korean gets a proper gothic web font fallback plus line-break and rhythm rules from the design review. New §10 story primitives are the only additions to the component set.

> **Redesign contract. Written 2026-09-08 from runtime extraction of three reference sites, StyleGallery pattern contracts, the frontend skill's Layer A/B references, and three imagen concept drafts.** This document replaces the 2026-06-24 extraction contract. Every color, size, spacing value, motion value, and component the site renders must trace to a token or primitive named here. If a value is missing, add it here first, then use it.

## 0. Research Log

One line per lane. A lane with no line did not run.

- **Reference site — omp.sh** (runtime `getComputedStyle`, 330 elements × 3 viewports, 17 hover targets driven): single-viewport poster console; substrate `#09090b`, hairlines `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`, **0px radii everywhere**, Geist 500 display `clamp(2.4rem, 1.2rem + 3.8vw, 4.4rem)` / lh 0.98 / tracking -0.03em, uppercase Geist captions 10–12px tracking 2.2–2.6px, the install command bar IS the CTA (accent prompt cell + mono command + fixed-width COPY), nav underline `scaleX(0→1)` 320ms `cubic-bezier(0.2,0.8,0.2,1)`, color transitions 150ms `cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)`, scrolled header `black/72% + blur(12px)`; focal object is a procedural Canvas2D grain horizon (not 3D). Report: `/tmp/omo-web-research/omp-sh/report.md`, tokens `tokens.json`, screenshots 375/768/1280 + hero.
- **Reference site — factory.ai** (runtime extraction, 12→4 track grid measured): pale industrial paper inverted for us; 1440px frame, 24/16px gutters, 3px controls vs 6–12px panels, `box-shadow: none` everywhere, header diffusion `backdrop-filter: blur(64px) saturate(1.5)` without a hard glass card, primary CTA inverts over 150ms, section separation by generous margins (96–160px), one real product demonstration (video) instead of decorative WebGL, headline text-resolution reveal with immediately readable fallback. Report: `/tmp/omo-web-research/factory-ai/report.md`.
- **Reference site — herdr.dev** (runtime extraction, 28 baseline colors): ink `#17171a`, 1440px frame with 1px side rules, gutters 16/20/34px, Archivo 900 display with heavy negative tracking, lavender single accent used sparingly, **stats strip** (large tabular numerals + 10px mono uppercase labels, 4 → 2×2 columns), feature rows as an **index / explanation / evidence ledger** (130 + 1fr + 1fr at 1280, evidence stacks below at ≤768), row hover tint accent/4%, 120ms feature hovers, 2200ms status-dot pulse, interactive HTML terminal as the product visual. Report: `/tmp/omo-web-research/herdr-dev/report.md`. (herdr shows a "backed by" investor line — explicitly NOT copied; see §12.)
- **StyleGallery spatial patterns** (curl, raw.githubusercontent.com/changeroa/StyleGallery): adopted `sticky-header` (nav; no internal scroll), `cover` (hero: `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto; min-block-size: 100dvh`), `grid-wrapper` (page frame: `1fr minmax(0, 90rem) 1fr` with full-bleed breakout tracks), `sticky-aside` (mass-ulw section: sticky title column beside the terminal), `reel` (reviews: horizontal scroll container OWNS scroll), `content-limiter` (manifesto prose 68ch), `fixed-sidenav-shell` (docs: `16rem minmax(0,1fr)` grid, `min-block-size: 0`, **`<main>` owns the scroll**). Structural decisions restated in our words; upstream prose not copied.
- **Embedded refs**: shortlisted `linear.app`, `warp`, `vercel`; picked **Layer A `gpt-tasteskill`** (AIDA chapters, 2-line hero rule, gapless bento, massive section spacing; GSAP replaced by CSS scroll-driven animation + IntersectionObserver per §6) + **Layer B `linear.app`** (luminance ladder, `rgba(255,255,255,0.05–0.08)` borders, single chromatic accent, weight ~500 UI text) with `warp` for the mono uppercase editorial labels. `redesign-skill` audit list applied to the existing UI (findings in §11).
- **Imagen concept drafts** (gpt-image-2 via Quotio, 1536×1024): `/tmp/omo-web-research/concepts/a-centered-graph.png`, `b-editorial-split.png`, `c-canvas-bottom-left.png` → **picked B (editorial split)** as the hero reference-fidelity contract: left text column (eyebrow → 2-line display → tagline → command bar → primary + text link), right two-thirds a lit DAG of icosahedral nodes in three waves with a numbered wave rail. A contributes the glass command pill; C contributes pulses travelling along edges.
- **Prior art (own)**: `planet-simulator/src/components/asteroid/Asteroid3D.tsx` — R3F scene with IntersectionObserver defer, WebGL probe + static image fallback, `prefers-reduced-motion` gate, `dpr=[1,2]`, Suspense SVG fallback; LHCI 100/100/100/100 mobile asserts; size-limit budgets. Adopted and tightened in §9.
- **Lazyweb**: skipped — the three user-supplied live references already cover real shipped agent-tool landing pages; recorded as intentional.

- **Motion study (2026-09-27)** — a public motion-design prompt template (one shape never cut; springs as closed-form step responses summed per retarget; the leading and trailing edges on different springs; blur content swap with separate enter/exit timing; a cursor driving every change; frames as a pure function of time; no `will-change` on scaled text) plus beui.dev `dynamic-island`, `action-swap` and `tabs` sources read via the curl recipe. It produced MorphStage (§5) and the §6 spring tokens. Ink + cyan, 0 radius and the transform-only rule are unchanged.

## 1. Atmosphere & Identity

An operations ledger read at night. The whole site is one framed sheet of ink ruled by hairlines; content lives in rows and cells, never in floating cards. Everything is still until it is _live_: the only light on the page comes from wires that carry work — the edges of the agent graph, the prompt glyph in the install bar, the active node, the cursor in the terminal — and that light is OmO cyan with a white-hot core.

**Signature material: ink + phosphor.** Flat ink surfaces step by luminance (`ink-0 → ink-3`), separated by 1px `line` hairlines with square corners. Cyan appears only where something is running, selectable, or verified. No gradients as decoration, no purple, no drop shadows.

**The memorable moment:** the hero's agent graph lights up wave by wave — the orchestrator, then the planners, then the workers — and you can grab it and orbit it. Two sections later the same wave grammar plays inside a terminal as `mass ulw` runs. The product's idea (a DAG of specialised agents scheduled in waves and verified at the end) is understood before a paragraph is read.

## 2. Color

### Ramp rules

- **Cyan is the only chromatic brand color** and it always means _live_: running, selectable, focused, verified. Decorative cyan is a defect. The ramp above is the only way cyan appears; never re-tint `#00d4ff` at an opacity that is not in the table.
- **Status colors mean status.** Green/amber/red appear as 8px dots or 1px indicators next to a state label, never as fills or headings.
- **Depth is luminance, not shadow.** `ink-0 → ink-3` is the elevation stack. `box-shadow` is banned except the two glow recipes in §7.
- **No pure `#000000` or `#ffffff`.** Floor `#09090b`, ceiling `#f5f5f7`.
- **Per-section accent colors are removed** (the violet/orange/pink/fuchsia/teal/indigo/amber/green/blue classes of the previous site). Agent identity is carried by the icon, the mono label, and position in the graph — not by a color.

## 3. Typography

### Stack

- Sans: `var(--font-geist-sans), ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif` (Geist via `next/font`, self-hosted, `display: swap`).
- Sans / ko (v3): `var(--font-geist-sans), "Pretendard Variable", Pretendard, "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Noto Sans KR", …` — Latin glyphs stay Geist, Hangul falls back to Pretendard (dynamic-subset web font linked from the root layout `<head>` with a preconnect; a CSS `@import` is dropped by the browser once Tailwind emits `@layer` first). Gothic only; never a serif or brush face for Korean.
- Mono: `var(--font-geist-mono), ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, monospace`.
- No serif. No Inter. Two Latin families only.

### Rules

- Display and Title always carry negative tracking; body never does.
- Body never below 14px; the 11px eyebrow is uppercase mono with 0.2em tracking, which is the readability floor for that role.
- Eyebrows are content labels, not chapter numerals. "SECTION 01" / "ABOUT" style meta-labels are banned; v3 removes the numbered wave rail too — no numeral labels anywhere on the landing page.
- CJK locales keep the existing base-layer rules: `letter-spacing: normal` on headings, `text-wrap: pretty`, `word-break: keep-all` (ko), `line-break: strict` (ja/zh). Display size for CJK drops one clamp step (`clamp(2.25rem, 1.25rem + 3.6vw, 4.5rem)`) so two lines still hold.
- Korean (v3, from the design review): H1/H2 weight 700 so the message carries; story prose uses `.prose-cjk` (line-height 1.8, 1.25em paragraph gap) so lines and paragraphs read as separate; a particle or ending never starts a line — keep `mass ulw를` together and let the following word wrap instead. Section boundaries are made by size and weight, not by more hairlines.

## 4. Spacing & Layout

### Base unit: 4px

| Token        | Value | Usage                                           |

### Frame and grid

- **Frame** (`grid-wrapper`): `grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(0, 90rem) 1fr`; content sits in the center track (max 1440px) and is bounded by 1px `--line` side rules at ≥ lg; full-bleed sections (hero glow, CTA band) span all three tracks.
- Gutters: 16px (< sm) → 20px (sm–lg) → 32px (≥ lg). Never `px-8` on mobile.
- Inner grid: 12 tracks / 24px gap at ≥ lg; 4 tracks / 16px gap below.
- Breakpoints: Tailwind defaults (sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280, 2xl 1536). The hero switches from stacked to editorial split at **lg**.
- Section rhythm: `py-16 lg:py-24`; the hero → proof strip and reviews → CTA gaps use `--space-40`. Sections are chapters; do not cramp.
- Hero: `cover` pattern, `min-h-[100dvh]` (never `h-screen`), `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto` with nav / content / proof-strip anchor.
- Docs shell: `fixed-sidenav-shell` — `grid-template-columns: 16rem minmax(0, 1fr)`, `min-block-size: 0` on the grid and both children, `<main>` is the scroll owner (`overflow: auto`), sidebar sticky inside its column. On < lg the sidebar collapses into a top disclosure; `<main>` keeps `min-inline-size: 0` and prose gets `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, code blocks `overflow-x: auto` — this fixes the recorded 390px horizontal overflow debt instead of carrying it.
- Manifesto: `content-limiter` at 68ch for prose; section breaks are ruled by `--line`, not by background swaps. The 2026-09-14 text (`/manifesto`) is read, not scanned: title (Display) → two-line subtitle (Title, `--text-mid`) → byline in Meta mono (`author · date`) → series note (Body/sm italic) → four chapters whose every paragraph is its own `lit-read` block in line mode (§10 `lit-lines`: each authored line lights as it crosses the fixed reading line, so one line is mid-sweep at a time and the reveal unit is the line-break unit) at Lead+1 (`text-xl` / `text-2xl` ≥ md, lh 1.7, `.prose-cjk`), `space-y-8` between paragraphs, `space-y-10` under the chapter Title → closing lead as one more reading block, `just ulw ulw` in mono Display, the CTA button, and a Body/sm footnote ruled by `--line` that links the archive. The January 2026 text lives at `/manifesto/2026-01` unchanged in look, under a ruled `ink-1` banner (`archive-banner.tsx`: Eyebrow `Old version · date`, one Body line on what it argued, link back).

### Rules

- Grid for multi-column; no flexbox percentage math.
- Radius scale: **0px** for panels, rows, cards, terminals; **2px** for buttons, chips, inputs; **50%** for status dots only. The work-media and message exceptions in §15 do not change this default.
- Cards exist only as bento cells inside a ruled grid (agents). No free-floating cards with borders + shadows.

## 5. Components (primitives + states)

All primitives live in `components/ui/*` (existing shadcn shells re-tokened) or `components/ledger/*` (new). Every state below must be visible in the primitive showcase route (`/design` in dev builds, excluded from the sitemap) at 375/768/1280 before any product screen uses it.

### Frame (`components/ledger/frame.tsx`)

- `grid-wrapper` implementation; renders the two side rules at ≥ lg. Props: `bleed?: boolean` for full-bleed children.

### Nav (`components/nav-header.tsx`)

- Sticky (`sticky-header`), height 60px, `--ink-0/72%` + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` after `scrollY > 24px` (transparent before), bottom hairline `--line`.
- Left: OmO mark (24px SVG from `.github/assets/omo-icon-light.svg` re-exported to `public/brand/omo-mark.svg`) + wordmark `OmO` (Geist 500 15px, -0.02em). The brand is `OmO` on every surface (nav, footer, titles, OG, JSON-LD); the old long-form name is never rendered.
- Center/right: links `Features · Docs · Manifesto` in `--text-mid` mono 12px uppercase 0.12em; hover → `--text-hi` with a 1px underline growing `scaleX(0→1)` 320ms.
- Right: GitHub chip (mono `★ 68.8k` live count, `--ink-1` fill, `--line` border) and primary button `Install` (sm size).
- Mobile: hamburger 44×44; sheet `--ink-3` with `--line` top rule; items 44px tall.
- States: default, scrolled, open (mobile), link hover/focus-visible (2px `--accent-32` outline offset 2px), active route (underline visible at scaleX(1), `--text-hi`).

### Button (`components/ui/button.tsx`)

- Variants: `primary` (fill `--accent`, text `#09090b`, hover fill `--accent-dim`, active `translateY(1px)`), `secondary` (fill `--ink-1`, border `--line-strong`, text `--text-hi`, hover border `--accent-32` + text `--accent`), `ghost` (text `--text-mid`, hover `--text-hi`), `link` (mono uppercase 12px with arrow, underline scaleX on hover).
- Sizes: sm `h-9 px-3 text-sm`, md `h-11 px-5 text-sm`, lg `h-12 px-6 text-base`. Radius 2px. Focus-visible: 2px `--accent-32` outline, offset 2px. Disabled: opacity .5, no pointer.
- Transitions: color/background/border 150ms `cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)`; transform 150ms.

### CommandBar (`components/landing/install-command.tsx`)

- The primary CTA of the site (omp.sh grammar). Row: prompt cell (40px wide, `--accent` `$`/`>` glyph on `--ink-2`), mono command in `--text-hi` on `--ink-1`, fixed-width COPY cell (mono uppercase 11px, `--text-lo` → `--text-hi` on hover). A click grows an `--accent-8` wash across the cell (`scaleX 0 → 1` on `--ease-spring`), blur-swaps COPY out (`--dur-swap-out`, blur `--swap-blur`) and a check (springing `scale .4 → 1`) + "COPIED" in (`--dur-swap-in`) in `--accent` for 2s. An `aria-live=polite` status announces the copy. The cell width never changes. 1px `--line` border, 0px radius, height 48px; on < sm the command scrolls horizontally inside the cell (no wrap) and COPY stays reachable.
- One command, no tab row (v3): every CommandBar on the site renders `bun install -g omo-ai`. Host/edition switching was removed with the Editions section; the bar is the whole install story.
- Glow: none by default; `focus-within` adds the inset ring `0 0 0 1px var(--accent-32)`.

### MorphStage (`components/landing/crafted/morph-stage.tsx`)

- The crafted section's demonstration: one `--ink-1` cell with the dot grid. Inside it, one shape never cuts. Four 1px `--line-strong` edges and an `--ink-2` fill morph between the eight crafted states. Content swaps in the shape's center.
- Geometry is a pure function of a virtual clock (`lib/morph-spring.ts`). Every edge is a sum of closed-form spring steps, one per target change, so a retarget mid-flight never snaps. The edge that grows in the direction of travel rides `--spring-lead` and the edge that follows rides `--spring-trail`, so the shape stretches before it settles.
- Only transforms change per frame (translate + scaleX/scaleY on the edges and fill, translate on content and cursor). There is no `will-change`; text is never scaled.
- Content swap: the outgoing scene leaves in `--dur-swap-out` with no blur, and the incoming one enters after 60ms over `--dur-swap-in` from `blur(--swap-blur) scale(.94)`. Separate enter and exit timing keeps text from overlapping.
- Live moment: `monitor` (build finished), `reload` (config applied) and `computer` (a click landed in a native app while the reader's focus stayed put) turn the fill `--accent-8` and the edges `--accent-32`. Cyan appears only when something woke, was applied, or was done.
- A scripted cursor (`--text-hi` arrow, `--ink-0` stroke) travels to the next state on a softer spring (ω 7.5, ζ .92), presses (scale .86 for 140ms), and the stage advances. Each state holds 2.8s.
- The list beside it (`crafted-list`) is the control. Hover (mouse only), focus, or click on an item moves the stage there, hides the scripted cursor, and holds for 6s before autoplay resumes. The active item gets `aria-current`, an `--accent-4` wash and an `--accent` dot that springs to full size.
- The clock advances only while the stage is ≥20% on screen and the tab is visible. Reduced motion: no frame loop and no cursor; the stage jumps to the selected state and shows its live moment statically.

### Eyebrow (`components/ledger/eyebrow.tsx`)

- Mono 11px uppercase 0.2em `--text-lo`; optional leading 24px hairline rule (`--line-strong`) like a ledger tab. Optional trailing status dot.

### ProofStrip (`components/landing/proof-strip.tsx`)

- 4 cells (2×2 < lg) separated by `--line`; each cell: Numeral (live from `/api/stats`, tabular, `--text-hi`) + Eyebrow label + icon 14px. Hover: cell fill `--accent-4`. Numbers count up once on enter (600ms) — meaning: they are live; reduced motion renders the final value.

### LedgerRow (`components/ledger/ledger-row.tsx`)

- Grid `[minmax(0,130px)] 1fr 1fr` at ≥ lg (index / explanation / evidence); `[54px] 1fr` below with evidence stacked under the explanation. Row padding 24px 0, hairline between rows, `--accent-4` fill on hover, index in Numeral style `--text-faint`. Used by the `/design` showcase; the landing page (v3) no longer renders ledger rows.
- States: default, hover, focus-within (index turns `--accent`), `data-active` (left 2px `--accent` rule) when linked from the graph.

### BentoCell (`components/ledger/bento-cell.tsx`)

- Cells of the agents grid (`grid-flow-dense`, 1px gaps revealing `--line`, so the grid itself draws the rules). Cell fill `--ink-1`, hover `--ink-2` + icon `--accent`, spans: orchestrator 2×2, planner 2×1, others 1×1; mobile 1 column, tablet 2. Content: icon 20px (Lucide/Phosphor SVG), name (Subheading), role (Body/sm `--text-mid`), model chip (Meta mono on `--ink-2`, `--line` border, 2px radius).
- Gapless verification: 4 columns × 4 rows desktop = 16 units: orchestrator 4 + planner 2 + 10 singles = 16. Tablet 2 columns: orchestrator 2×2, planner 2×1, 10 singles → 4 + 2 + 10 = 16 = 2 × 8 rows. No holes.

### Terminal (`components/landing/terminal.tsx`)

- HTML/CSS terminal (herdr grammar): chrome bar (`--ink-2`, three 8px status dots `--text-faint`, title mono meta), sidebar `--ink-3` at ≥ md listing waves, body `--code-bg` mono 13px `--code-fg`. Cursor block `--accent-hot` blinking 1s steps(1). Scroll-gated typewriter of `mass ulw …` at 40ms/char once 40% visible; then wave rows render one by one with status dots `--status-busy → --status-ok`; final line `verified ✓` flashes `--accent-hot` → `--text-hi`. Reduced motion: renders the final frame immediately.
- Interactive: clicking a wave row highlights that wave's nodes in the hero graph if the hero is mounted (shared `useGraphFocus` store), otherwise it is inert but styled as `data-active`.

### Reel (`components/ledger/reel.tsx`)

- `display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column; grid-auto-columns: minmax(280px, 34%); overflow-x: auto; scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;` the reel owns the scroll; edge fade masks 32px; keyboard: cells are focusable, arrow keys scroll by one cell. Used by Reviews.

### Chip (`components/ui/badge.tsx` → `Chip`)

- Mono Meta text, `--ink-2` fill, `--line` border, 2px radius, 24px tall; `accent` variant fills `--accent-8` with `--accent` text (live/selected only).

### DocsShell (`components/docs/docs-shell.tsx`)

- `fixed-sidenav-shell` as in §4; sidebar: search input (Chip-styled, focus ring), section list with active item marked by a 2px `--accent` left rule; main: prose with `--line` ruled H2s, code blocks `--code-bg` with `overflow-x: auto`.

### Footer (`components/footer.tsx`)

- Top hairline, `py-12`, grid 2 → 4 columns: brand + copyright (mono meta: "© {year} Sisyphus Labs · Source-available under SUL-1.0"), Product (Docs, Manifesto, Releases), Community (GitHub, Discord, X @justsisyphus), Legal (Privacy, Terms). Links `--text-lo` → `--text-hi`. No investor/affiliation lines.

## 6. Motion & Interaction

| Token              | Value                            | Usage                                                    |

| `--dur-pulse`      | 2200ms                           | status dot pulse (opacity 1 → .55 → 1)                   |
| `--dur-wave`       | 12s cycle                        | graph wave loop (shared by 3D scene and terminal)        |
| `--dur-swap-out`   | 80ms                             | outgoing content in a morph (no blur)                    |

### Rules

- Only `transform`, `opacity`, `filter` and the color family (`color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, `fill`, `stroke`) animate — never layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, margin, padding). Height morphs (mobile nav) use `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` on a wrapper, not `max-height`.
- Entrance: `.reveal` content is visible by default — motion only enhances it, so server HTML, no-JS and browsers without scroll timelines (Firefox) never hide content. It uses `animation-timeline: view()` (`animation-range: entry 0% entry 40%`) when `@supports (animation-timeline: view())`; otherwise the `Reveal` component arms `data-reveal="pending"` only on elements that start below the fold, after hydration, and an IntersectionObserver clears it once. Stagger `calc(var(--index) * 60ms)`. Each element reveals once.
- Every motion maps to a state or affordance: hover → underline/tint, press → 1px translate, live data → count-up, scene progress → wave lights. Motion on non-interactive decoration is banned (this includes floating shapes, parallax, cursor trails, magnetic buttons, scroll-jacking).
- Springs are closed-form step responses (`lib/morph-spring.ts`), not a library. A value that retargets is the sum of one step per change, so it stays continuous and interruptible. CSS springs use `--ease-spring`, the same lead spring sampled into `linear()` with a cubic-bezier fallback declared first.
- No motion library. GSAP, Lottie, `framer-motion` are banned; `motion/react` is allowed only for a `layoutId` shared-layout need, currently unused.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: reveals render final state, count-ups render final numbers, terminal renders its final frame, typewriter and pulses stop, the 3D scene is not mounted (poster only).
- Interaction mechanics traced to beui.dev catalog patterns: `action-swap` blur preset (COPY → check + COPIED: exit fast and blur-free, enter from blur), `dynamic-island` (MorphStage: one shell springing between views, content blur crossfade, exit 80ms before the enter), `tabs` (the active crafted dot: spring indicator), `number` (count-up), `tabs` underline indicator (command bar tabs, CSS-only), `tooltip`-style label chip for hovered graph nodes (opacity 150ms).

## 7. Depth & Surface

Strategy: **tonal shift + hairline**. Surfaces are flat ink; separation is 1px `--line`; elevation is one ink step.

| Level | Fill      | Rule            | Usage                          |
| ----- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0     | `--ink-0` | —               | page                           |
| 1     | `--ink-1` | `--line`        | rows, command bar, bento cells |
| 2     | `--ink-2` | `--line`        | hover, terminal chrome, chips  |
| 3     | `--ink-3` | `--line-strong` | mobile sheet, terminal sidebar |

Allowed glow recipes (the only `box-shadow`/gradient decoration on the site):

- **Selection ring**: `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--accent-32)` (focus-within, selected tile).
- **Hero wash**: `radial-gradient(circle at 70% 45%, var(--accent-16), transparent 46%)` behind the graph, plus a `--line-faint` dot grid (`radial-gradient(var(--line-faint) 1px, transparent 1px)` at 28px) — both static.
- **Scrolled nav**: `--ink-0/72%` + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`.
- The 3D node halos are additive sprites inside the canvas, not CSS.

Grain is not used (omp.sh's canvas grain and factory's texture PNG would fight the 3D scene); the dot grid is the texture.

## 8. Accessibility

- `<html lang>` per locale; unique `<title>` per route; skip link to `#main-content`; landmarks `header/nav/main/footer/section[aria-labelledby]`.
- Contrast: `--text-hi` on `--ink-0` 17.8:1, `--text-mid` 11.5:1, `--text-lo` 5.9:1 (AA for 11px+ mono uppercase is met because eyebrows are ≥ 11px 500 with tracking; body never uses `--text-faint`), `--accent` on `--ink-0` 11.4:1, primary button `#09090b` on `--accent` 11.4:1.
- Focus-visible ring on every interactive element (2px `--accent-32`, offset 2px); the canvas wrapper is focusable with arrow-key orbit and is `aria-hidden` for AT while the poster `<img alt>` describes the scene.
- Touch targets ≥ 44px on mobile (nav items, COPY cell, bento cells are ≥ 44px tall).
- Reduced motion honored everywhere (§6). Reduced data (`navigator.connection.saveData`) and low memory skip the 3D chunk (§9).
- Reel and docs main announce as scroll regions (`role="region"` + `aria-label`, `tabindex=0`).
- Personas: terminal power user (keyboard-first, copyable commands, dense reference), mobile evaluator (no horizontal overflow on `/`, `/manifesto`, `/docs` at 375), CJK reader (heading tracking reset, keep-all), motion-sensitive user (poster hero, static terminal).

## 9. The Graph — 3D interactive hero scene

### Meaning

The GitHub one-liner calls the user "the master of graph engineering". The focal object is that graph: a directed acyclic graph of agent nodes scheduled in waves by `mass ulw`. Wave 1 = orchestrator (lead) → wave 2 = Ultrawork Planner, Plan Consultant, Plan Reviewer (plan + gates) → wave 3 = Kibitzer, Architect, Deep, Quick, Visual Engineering, Explore, Librarian (categories and curated agents, execution). A 12s loop lights the waves in order, pulses travel down the edges, and a final "verified" flash settles the graph.

### Content and geometry

- Desktop 11 nodes / mobile 7 (drop Plan Consultant, Kibitzer, Quick, Visual Engineering). Positions precomputed in `components/landing/graph/graph-data.ts` (seeded, three planes along -Z).
- Node = icosahedron (detail 1) `MeshStandardMaterial` (`--ink-3` base, emissive `--accent-dim`, emissiveIntensity 0.2 idle → 1.6 lit) + one additive-blended halo sprite (shared 64×64 radial CanvasTexture, `--accent-16` → transparent). No bloom / postprocessing.
- Edges = one `LineSegments` geometry, `--accent-dim` at 0.35 opacity; lit edge 0.8.
- Pulses = one `Points` object (≤ 48 desktop / 24 mobile) whose `t` along its edge advances per frame in a typed array; size 6px, `--accent-hot`.
- Labels: a single drei `<Html>` chip (Chip primitive, mono) for the hovered/focused node only.
- Lights: 1 ambient (0.25) + 1 directional (1.2, cool). No shadows, no env map.

### Interaction

- Drag/touch-drag orbits (OrbitControls: `enableZoom=false`, `enablePan=false`, `enableDamping`, `dampingFactor 0.08`, polar angle clamped to `[π/3, 2π/3]`). Auto-rotate 0.15 rad/s when idle; pauses on interaction, resumes 4s after the last input.
- Hover → node halo brightens + label chip; click/tap → camera eases to the node (600ms `--ease-out-quart`) and the matching agent bento cell receives `data-active`; Escape / empty click resets.
- Keyboard: wrapper is focusable; ← → rotate 15°, Enter focuses the nearest node, Escape resets.

### Performance contract (planet-simulator pattern, tightened)

- `next/dynamic(() => import("./graph-scene"), { ssr: false })` mounted only when ALL hold: hero IntersectionObserver hit; `requestIdleCallback` fired (fallback 200ms timeout); `!matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches`; WebGL2 context probe succeeded; `navigator.deviceMemory` ≥ 2 when present; `navigator.connection?.saveData !== true`.
- Poster `/images/graph-poster.webp` (1600×1000, ≤ 60 KB, rendered from the scene) is the LCP: explicit `width/height`, `fetchPriority="high"`, `sizes` per breakpoint. The canvas fades in over it (opacity 400ms) after its first frame; the poster stays as the fallback for reduced-motion / no-WebGL / low-end / runtime error (ErrorBoundary).
- Canvas: `dpr={[1, isMobile ? 1.25 : 1.75]}`, `gl={{ antialias: !isMobile, powerPreference: "high-performance", alpha: true }}`, `frameloop="always"` only while the hero is on screen and the tab visible, otherwise `"demand"`; after 20s without interaction, `"demand"` with one `invalidate()` per second to keep the wave loop alive.
- Budget: the lazy renderer chunks (three core + @react-three/fiber + react-reconciler + the two drei modules) ≤ 224 KB gzip total, asserted by `scripts/check-graph-budget.mjs` (`bun run check:graph-budget`); three must not appear in the first-load JS of `/` (checked against the app build manifest). Measured 2026-09-08: 209.3 KB gzip across two chunks (163.4 + 45.9); three's core alone is ~150 KB gzip and is irreducible, so the budget is set at measured + 7% headroom rather than the 190 KB first estimate. drei is imported per module, never the barrel.
- Lighthouse guard: chunk loads after LCP; TBT contribution ≤ 50ms on the mobile preset; the poster keeps CLS at 0.

## 9b. Landing story (v3) and the §10 story primitives

### Section order (`app/_components/landing-page.tsx`)

`hero` → `proof` → `secret` → `ultrawork` → `multi-model` → `mass-ulw` → `kibitzer` → `skills` → `crafted` → `platforms` → `reviews` → `cta`. Editions, the agent roster, profiles, orchestration, team mode and the principles ledger were removed from `/`; their substance lives in docs and inside `crafted`. No section carries a numeral label.

- **secret**: the fold. The body alone owns the word sweep, from its top at 80vh until its bottom reaches 50vh. Every word then remains fully lit for `--lit-read-hold: 18vh` of additional scroll with the follow-up fully hidden. The follow-up has an independent opacity/rise animation over `--lit-follow-fade: 22vh`, starting only after both the reading hold and its untransformed top crossing the viewport midpoint. `--lit-follow-gap: 1.25em` preserves the existing prose paragraph gap (40px mobile, about 64px desktop); `--lit-follow-rise: var(--space-6)` preserves the 24px rise. No extra layout space or time-based delay is added. Anchoring completion to the body's bottom, not the combined block or its containment range, keeps taller Korean mobile paragraphs correct and the follow-up on-screen while appearing.
- The secret body preserves authored newline boundaries with `white-space: pre-line`. English uses three short sentences, one per line on desktop; each sentence may wrap naturally on mobile. Whitespace stays outside animated word spans, preserving both readable spacing and the continuous sweep.
- **ultrawork**: prompt line with the keyword as a `--accent-16` mark + three revealed steps. No product jargon in the copy.
- **multi-model**: two `Marquee` rows of tuned profile chips (opposite directions, 36s / 44s, pause on hover). The chip list is data (`story-data.ts`) and never names families outside Claude / GPT / Kimi / Grok / GLM / DeepSeek.
- **mass-ulw**: the existing desktop-app DAG (`dag/`) on a research → dataset → model → deck scenario (`scenario-data.ts`).
- **kibitzer**: two concurrent loops, a narrow inexpensive memory-watching sidecar and a larger expensive frontier agent. Independent active markers run on `--kib-watch-cycle: 4.5s` (three beats) and `--kib-main-cycle: 14s` (four beats); the main turn counter advances on each animation iteration. A `--kib-cycle: 14s` story sends one nudge from memory across the gutter into a reserved slot between acting and verifying, replacing the skipped migration test with running it first at 50% of the story. The loops continue throughout. One IntersectionObserver pauses the stage offscreen. Below md, the sidecar becomes a compact top strip and the nudge travels vertically. Reduced motion shows the inserted nudge and corrected step, without animation.
  - Stage geometry: desktop columns `minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 2fr)`, gap `--space-12`, padding `--space-5`; mobile gap `--space-8`, padding `--space-4`. Ruled loop rows use `--space-12` minimum height, insertion slot `--space-24` minimum height. Nudge starts at `translateX(calc(-50% - var(--space-12))) scale(.5)` on desktop; mobile starts at `translateY(calc(-1 * (var(--space-40) + var(--space-24)))) scale(.8)`. Transform origin is left center; 0–30% hidden at source, 32–38% produced, 38–50% in flight, 50–94% inserted, 98–100% reset. Text stays full opacity except hidden/replaced story states; only the active row changes color. All other dimensions, type, colors and rules reuse §§2–6.
- **skills**: a vertical `Ticker` of `name · blurb` rows (30s, pause on hover) next to the copy.
- **crafted**: sticky copy column + a single-column rise-up list (`Reveal` with `--index` stagger); the docs link is the only CTA.
- **platforms**: title with a `RotatingWord` (13 platforms, 1.6s per word, `steps()`), then every platform once as a `Chip`, revealed with stagger, and a footnote-style "coming soon" line under the list.

| `LitProgress` / `LitWords` | JS registers interpolated `--lit-p` before enabling the named body view timeline; longhand range `cover 20vh → cover calc(100% - 50vh)` works for short and taller-than-viewport bodies. Independent follow range starts after `max(--lit-read-hold, --lit-follow-gap)` beyond word completion and lasts `--lit-follow-fade`. Per-word gradient sweep + `--lit-blur` 4px→0 with a 3-unit overlap (react-bits `ScrollReveal` mechanism, no tilt). If registration or either timeline is unavailable/inactive, an IntersectionObserver gates animation-frame geometry sampling while the block intersects; it does not rely on intersection-ratio changes, which stop for fully visible or viewport-spanning blocks. The `.lit-follow` element is optional (a block without one sweeps its words alone). `LitWords` accepts `parts` so a run of words can sit inside an external link (`.lit-link`: accent underline, thicker on hover/focus) while the sweep continues across it. **`lit-read` variant** (manifesto paragraphs): unread words sit at `--text-lo` instead of `--text-faint`, `--lit-blur` is 2px, and `[data-lit-mode="pending"]` forces `--lit-p: 1`, so the page reads in full before hydration and under JS failure. **`lit-lines` mode** (`LitProgress lines` + `LitWords lines`): every authored line renders as a `.lit-line` block with its own `--lit-count` and its own `view()` timeline, range `cover calc(100vh - --lit-line - --lit-band) → cover calc(100% - --lit-line + --lit-band)` (`--lit-line: 50vh`, `--lit-band: 1vh`), so words light exactly while their line crosses the reading line; lines never overlap vertically, so at most one line (plus the first words of the next) is in transition. The parent's named-timeline sweep is disabled in this mode; the observer fallback samples each line's rect against the same reading line. | `--lit-p: 1`, follow fully visible, plain `--text-hi`, no gradient, blur or transform |

All five use CSS keyframes or IntersectionObserver; no scroll listeners, no motion library (§6 rule unchanged). The lit fallback samples geometry on animation frames only while intersecting, stops when off-screen/hidden, and recomputes on re-entry, visibility changes, resize and `scrollend` (one event per settled gesture, so a jump that skips a block still lands it in the right state). Its progress is reversible and based on scroll distance, never elapsed time.

## 11. Redesign audit (what the previous site got wrong, per `redesign-skill`)

- Per-section rainbow accents (violet/orange/pink/fuchsia/teal/indigo/amber/green/blue) — removed (§2).
- Three-equal-column feature grids (Reviews, Architecture) and 5-column step rows — replaced by ledger rows, a gapless bento, and a reel (§5).
- `rounded-xl/3xl` cards with `bg-zinc-900/30` + border + shadow — replaced by ruled ink cells with 0px radius (§4, §7).
- Stats crammed into the hero — moved to the proof strip; the hero carries one statement, one tagline, one command, two actions (§5, gpt-tasteskill hero rule).
- Static hero photograph fading behind text — replaced by the meaningful 3D graph with a poster LCP (§9).
- Bold-everywhere headlines (`font-bold` 700 at 72px) — Geist 500 with -0.03em tracking (§3).
- Docs horizontal overflow at 390px carried as debt — fixed by the shell contract (§4).
- Static OG PNG — dynamic `next/og` image using the same palette, Geist subsets, and the graph glyph (`app/opengraph-image.tsx`).

## 12. Banned Patterns (project-specific)

- Any mention of investors, accelerators, or "backed by" lines anywhere on the site, in OG images, or in metadata. (Confidential; the reference site herdr.dev carries one — do not mirror it.)
- Raw hex or rgba outside this file, `app/styles/design-system.css`, and `lib/og/palette.ts`.
- `#000000`, `#ffffff`, purple/blue gradients, decorative cyan, per-section accent colors.
- Border radius other than 0 / 2px / 50%, except the scoped work-media and message tokens in §15.
- `h-screen`; `max-height` animations; animating layout properties.
- Three-equal-column feature card grids; floating bordered cards with shadows.
- Emojis in JSX, alt text, or visible UI. Icons are SVG (Lucide / Phosphor).
- Meta-labels ("SECTION 01", "ABOUT US"); generic hype copy ("seamless", "unleash", "next-gen").
- `framer-motion`, GSAP, Lottie; `export const runtime = "edge"`; `any` casts and TS suppressions.
- Importing the `@react-three/drei` barrel; mounting the 3D scene before the gates in §9 pass; shipping the scene without the poster.
- Serif or Inter typefaces; Korean serif fallbacks.

## 13. Accepted debt

- `/design` showcase route is dev-only and not localized.
- The 3D poster is rendered once per design change by `scripts/render-graph-poster.mjs` (Playwright screenshot of the mounted scene); it is a committed asset, not generated at build.
- Satori cannot read CSS variables, so `lib/og/palette.ts` duplicates §2 values; a `scripts/check-og-palette.mjs` diff against `design-system.css` guards drift.

## 14. Brand OG image (2026-09-14)

The supplied Figma OG composition supersedes the dark graph OG in §11, for
social images only. Its API geometry supplies the original cat and designed-vector
OmO wordmark. The wordmark is not typeset. The new headline uses the source's
Roboto Mono family, Regular 400 followed by Bold 700.

- Canvas: 1200 x 630 PNG. White `#ffffff` paper and `#0a0a0a` ink are explicit
  reference-specific exceptions to §2/§12. No gradient, border, shadow, or graph.
- Composition: cat at (162, 196), width 282, original 325.0923:289.9436 aspect.
  Wordmark at (494, 204), width 390, original 499:156 aspect.
- Headline: (494, 349), Roboto Mono 36 px, 46 px line height, zero tracking.
  Two unbroken lines: “Your tool for real work.” (400), “But it's an agent.” (700).
  The original tagline's special capital-O glyph does not occur in the new copy.
- Proof: top-left (48, top 42), Roboto Mono 48 px, one row of two items 44 px
  apart, each a 52 px mark + 18 px gap + label. Stars: GitHub mark, whole-thousand
  floor, uppercase K and plus, e.g. 69,999 → `69K+ Stars`. Downloads: npm mark,
  all-time npm total of `oh-my-opencode` + `oh-my-openagent` + `omo-ai` +
  `lazycodex-ai` (`lib/npm-downloads.ts`) plus every `omo-*` compiled binary
  downloaded from GitHub releases (`lib/native-downloads.ts`), the same figure
  as the site total, floored to
  0.1 M, e.g. 4,032,665 → `4M+ Downloads`, 3,894,680 → `3.8M+ Downloads`.
  Counts below 1,000 remain exact. No website label.
- Star states: fresh/cached for up to 5 minutes; last known good for at most
  24 hours on GitHub failure; otherwise `GitHub` without an invented count.
  Download states: fetched independently of stars (an npm outage never freezes
  stars), fresh for 1 hour, last known good for at most 24 hours, otherwise the
  downloads item is omitted. Each refresh makes two attempts, and every good
  figure is also kept in the colo-shared Workers Cache API (24 h), so a freshly
  started isolate (the one a crawler usually hits) reuses it instead of dropping
  the figure. Any degraded figure makes the response `no-store`;
  otherwise `s-maxage` is the smallest remaining freshness.
- Both social routes render on demand, not as build snapshots. Fonts and artwork
  are bundled into the renderer; no runtime font CDN, Figma URL, or npm request.
- Accessibility/QA: descriptive metadata alt, high-contrast text, native-size
  PNG plus 600/375 px preview inspection; check full vector silhouettes and
  unbroken text at every scale. No client JavaScript or interaction is added.

## 15. Readable work surfaces (2026-09-14)

This is a restrained visual refinement of the existing landing, informed by
the readable conversation illustrations and selective softness at
`sisyphuslabs.ai/en`. The reference contributes local presentation, not its
copy, persona, rounded navigation or waitlist positioning.

The headline, authored locale copy, section order, cat/wordmark, cyan palette,
install controls, DAG nodes and Secret reading sequence stay unchanged.
The hero remains the editorial split and the actual desktop DAG, not the
historical 3D concept described in §9.

### Type and whitespace

- Feature titles rendered by `SectionHeader` use `.type-feature`:
  `clamp(2rem, 1.5rem + 1.6vw, 2.5rem)`, weight 500, line-height 1.1,
  tracking -0.025em and balanced wrapping. Hero, Secret and CTA display
  roles do not change. Existing CJK heading rules still apply.
- Feature introductions use the existing 18px Lead role with 1.7 leading
  and a 60ch measure, rather than increasing to 20px beside the work media.
- The ultrawork request uses the existing 16px Body role and wraps in a
  shrinking grid track; its keyword remains an unbroken inline mark.
  Request and response rows use 20px padding, rising to 24px horizontally
  above the small breakpoint.
- The desktop illustration's request and assistant response use the
  existing 14px Body/sm role with 1.625 leading. Human text is not
  truncated; graph metadata and graph-node geometry stay compact.
- Kibitzer memory and nudge prose use the 16px Body role with 1.6 leading.
  The stage padding is 20px on mobile and 32px from the medium breakpoint,
  retaining the current 32px/48px column gaps and insertion slot.

### Scoped surface tokens

- `--radius-work: 12px`: outside shell of the ultrawork exchange, hero
  graph panel, desktop work illustration and Kibitzer stage only.
- `--radius-message: 8px`: the existing user message bubble and Kibitzer
  nudge only. Nested controls, graph nodes, rows and install bars retain
  their existing radii.
- Reuse ink surfaces and hairlines; no new color, shadow, glow or image.
  Clip the terminal/exchange shells at their rounded outside edge.
  The Kibitzer stage must not clip its travelling nudge.

### Motion, accessibility and verification

All existing work-progress and memory-intervention clocks, visibility gates,
states and reduced-motion alternatives are preserved. Surface softness adds
no animation or JavaScript.

Feature labels rendered by `SectionHeader` keep their status colors but do
not pulse: the labels name capabilities, not live work. Use the existing
Eyebrow `className` hook for this local override; other status indicators
