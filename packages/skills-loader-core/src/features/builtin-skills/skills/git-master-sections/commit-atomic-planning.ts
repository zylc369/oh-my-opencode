export const GIT_MASTER_COMMIT_ATOMIC_PLANNING_SECTION = `## PHASE 3: Atomic Unit Planning (BLOCKING - MUST OUTPUT BEFORE PROCEEDING)

<atomic_planning>
**THIS PHASE HAS MANDATORY OUTPUT** - You MUST print the commit plan before moving to Phase 4.

### 3.0 Calculate Minimum Commit Count FIRST

\`\`\`
FORMULA: min_commits = ceil(file_count / 3)

 3 files -> min 1 commit
 5 files -> min 2 commits
 9 files -> min 3 commits
15 files -> min 5 commits
\`\`\`

**If your planned commit count < min_commits -> WRONG. SPLIT MORE.**

### 3.1 Split by Directory/Module FIRST (Primary Split)

**RULE: Different directories = Different commits (almost always)**

\`\`\`
Example: 8 changed files
  - app/[locale]/page.tsx
  - app/[locale]/layout.tsx
  - components/demo/browser-frame.tsx
  - components/demo/shopify-full-site.tsx
  - components/pricing/pricing-table.tsx
  - e2e/navbar.spec.ts
  - messages/en.json
  - messages/ko.json

WRONG: 1 commit "Update landing page" (LAZY, WRONG)
WRONG: 2 commits (still too few)

CORRECT: Split by directory/concern:
  - Commit 1: app/[locale]/page.tsx + layout.tsx (app layer)
  - Commit 2: components/demo/* (demo components)
  - Commit 3: components/pricing/* (pricing components)
  - Commit 4: e2e/* (tests)
  - Commit 5: messages/* (i18n)
  = 5 commits from 8 files (CORRECT)
\`\`\`

### 3.2 Split by Concern SECOND (Secondary Split)

**Within same directory, split by logical concern:**

\`\`\`
Example: components/demo/ has 4 files
  - browser-frame.tsx (UI frame)
  - shopify-full-site.tsx (specific demo)
  - review-dashboard.tsx (NEW - specific demo)
  - tone-settings.tsx (NEW - specific demo)

Option A (acceptable): 1 commit if ALL tightly coupled
Option B (preferred): 2 commits
  - Commit: "Update existing demo components" (browser-frame, shopify)
  - Commit: "Add new demo components" (review-dashboard, tone-settings)
\`\`\`

### 3.3 NEVER Do This (Anti-Pattern Examples)

\`\`\`
WRONG: "Refactor entire landing page" - 1 commit with 15 files
WRONG: "Update components and tests" - 1 commit mixing concerns
WRONG: "Big update" - Any commit touching 5+ unrelated files

RIGHT: Multiple focused commits, each 1-4 files max
RIGHT: Each commit message describes ONE specific change
RIGHT: A reviewer can understand each commit in 30 seconds
\`\`\`

### 3.4 Implementation + Test Pairing (MANDATORY)

\`\`\`
RULE: Test files MUST be in same commit as implementation

Test patterns to match:
- test_*.py <-> *.py
- *_test.py <-> *.py
- *.test.ts <-> *.ts
- *.spec.ts <-> *.ts
- __tests__/*.ts <-> *.ts
- tests/*.py <-> src/*.py
\`\`\`

### 3.5 MANDATORY JUSTIFICATION (Before Creating Commit Plan)

**NON-NEGOTIABLE: Before finalizing your commit plan, you MUST:**

\`\`\`
FOR EACH planned commit with 3+ files:
  1. List all files in this commit
  2. Write ONE sentence explaining why they MUST be together
  3. If you can't write that sentence -> SPLIT

TEMPLATE:
"Commit N contains [files] because [specific reason they are inseparable]."

VALID reasons:
  VALID: "implementation file + its direct test file"
  VALID: "type definition + the only file that uses it"
  VALID: "migration + model change (would break without both)"

INVALID reasons (MUST SPLIT instead):
  INVALID: "all related to feature X" (too vague)
  INVALID: "part of the same PR" (not a reason)
  INVALID: "they were changed together" (not a reason)
  INVALID: "makes sense to group" (not a reason)
\`\`\`

**OUTPUT THIS JUSTIFICATION in your analysis before executing commits.**

### 3.7 Dependency Ordering

\`\`\`
Level 0: Utilities, constants, type definitions
Level 1: Models, schemas, interfaces
Level 2: Services, business logic
Level 3: API endpoints, controllers
Level 4: Configuration, infrastructure

COMMIT ORDER: Level 0 -> Level 1 -> Level 2 -> Level 3 -> Level 4
\`\`\`

### 3.8 Create Commit Groups

For each logical feature/change:
\`\`\`yaml
- group_id: 1
  feature: "Add Shopify discount deletion"
  files:
    - errors/shopify_error.py
    - types/delete_input.py
    - mutations/update_contract.py
    - tests/test_update_contract.py
  dependency_level: 2
  target_commit: null | <existing-hash>  # null = new, hash = fixup
\`\`\`

### 3.9 MANDATORY OUTPUT (BLOCKING)

**You MUST output this block before proceeding to Phase 4. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

\`\`\`
COMMIT PLAN
===========
Files changed: N
Minimum commits required: ceil(N/3) = M
Planned commits: K
Status: K >= M (PASS) | K < M (FAIL - must split more)

COMMIT 1: [message in detected style]
  - path/to/file1.py
  - path/to/file1_test.py
  Justification: implementation + its test

COMMIT 2: [message in detected style]
  - path/to/file2.py
  Justification: independent utility function

COMMIT 3: [message in detected style]
  - config/settings.py
  - config/constants.py
  Justification: tightly coupled config changes

Execution order: Commit 1 -> Commit 2 -> Commit 3
(follows dependency: Level 0 -> Level 1 -> Level 2 -> ...)
\`\`\`

**VALIDATION BEFORE EXECUTION:**
- Each commit has <=4 files (or justified)
- Each commit message matches detected STYLE + LANGUAGE
- Test files paired with implementation
- Different directories = different commits (or justified)
- Total commits >= min_commits

**IF ANY CHECK FAILS, DO NOT PROCEED. REPLAN.**
