// touched, and a session that already started executing (ulw-execute) must not be pulled back into
// plan review. This module owns the classification data and the pure verdict logic; the
// session-scoped skill-invocation state is supplied by the host adapter (omo-senpi) via
// TaskToolDeps.resolveSkillInvocations, keeping senpi-task harness-neutral.
