export const codexHarnessToolCompatibility = `## Codex Harness Tool Compatibility

This skill may include examples copied from the OpenCode harness. In Codex, do not call OpenCode-only tools such as \`call_omo_agent(...)\`, \`task(...)\`, \`background_output(...)\`, or \`team_*(...)\` literally. Translate those examples to Codex native tools:

| OpenCode example | Codex tool to use |
| --- | --- |
| \`call_omo_agent(subagent_type="explore", ...)\` | \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as an explorer. ...","agent_type":"explorer","fork_context":false})\` |
| \`call_omo_agent(subagent_type="librarian", ...)\` | \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a librarian. ...","agent_type":"librarian","fork_context":false})\` |
| \`task(subagent_type="plan", ...)\` | \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a planning agent. ...","agent_type":"plan","fork_context":false})\` |
| \`task(subagent_type="oracle", ...)\` for final verification | By default, record a self-review in the notepad: re-read the diff, run diagnostics, and capture evidence for every acceptance criterion. Only when the user demanded strict, rigorous, or high-accuracy review, use \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a rigorous reviewer. ...","agent_type":"lazycodex-gate-reviewer","fork_context":false})\`; include \`fork_context: false\`. |
| \`task(category="...", ...)\` for implementation or QA | \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as an implementation or QA worker. ...","agent_type":"lazycodex-worker-medium","fork_context":false})\` |
| \`background_output(task_id="...")\` | \`multi_agent_v1.wait_agent(...)\` for mailbox signals |
| \`team_*(...)\` | Use Codex native subagents via \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent\` and \`multi_agent_v1.wait_agent\`; use \`multi_agent_v1.send_input\` and \`multi_agent_v1.close_agent\` only when exposed in the active tools list |

Role-specific behavior must be described in a self-contained \`message\`. Use \`fork_context: false\` to start the child with only the initial prompt (no parent history); use \`fork_context: true\` only when full parent history is truly required. Include any required conversation context, files, diffs, constraints, and requested skill names directly in the spawned agent's \`message\`. OMO installs these selectable agent roles into \`~/.codex/agents/\`: \`explorer\`, \`librarian\`, \`plan\`, \`momus\`, \`metis\`, \`lazycodex-code-reviewer\`, \`lazycodex-qa-executor\`, and \`lazycodex-gate-reviewer\` - pass the matching name as \`agent_type\` so the child gets that role's model and instructions. Inspect the actual spawn schema: whenever \`agent_type\` is exposed, EVERY spawn MUST select an exact LazyCodex role, on V1 or V2. Implementation difficulty selects \`lazycodex-worker-low\`, \`lazycodex-worker-medium\`, or \`lazycodex-worker-high\`; clone QA can select \`lazycodex-clone-fidelity-reviewer\`. Never select generic \`worker\` or \`default\`. If a code block below conflicts with this section, this section wins.

Codex exposes ONE of two subagent tool surfaces per session; check your own tool list and route accordingly. If \`multi_agent_v1.*\` tools exist, use the table above as written. If instead a flat \`spawn_agent\` with a required \`task_name\` exists (\`multi_agent_v2\`), rewrite every \`multi_agent_v1.*\` example: \`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({...,"fork_context":false})\` becomes \`spawn_agent({"task_name":"<lowercase_digits_underscores>","message":...,"agent_type":...,"fork_turns":"none"})\` (\`"all"\` only when full parent history is truly required); \`send_input\` becomes \`send_message\`; do not call \`close_agent\`/\`resume_agent\` (finished agents end on their own; \`followup_task\` re-tasks one, \`interrupt_agent\` stops one); \`wait_agent\` takes only \`timeout_ms\` and returns on any child mailbox activity. Do not infer role support from V1/V2 or a model version. Legacy-schema exception: only if the actual schema lacks \`agent_type\`, omit that unsupported field and carry the complete role instructions in \`message\`, with history explicitly disabled. This cannot select a specialized TOML; an installed managed default supplies the medium worker for unnamed non-forks. The guard has no schema metadata and rejects unnamed calls, so report incompatible routing instead of retrying generically. Every deliberate full-history fork must still name its role: Codex skips role application on unnamed full-history forks, an upstream gap no LazyCodex default can repair. If a code block below conflicts with this section, this section wins. \`fork_context\` is rejected on \`multi_agent_v2\` (\`fork_context is not supported in MultiAgentV2; use fork_turns instead\`).

When translating \`load_skills=[...]\`, include the requested skill names in the spawned agent's \`message\`. If a code block below conflicts with this section, this section wins.

Omit optional keys you do not set. Never send \`items: []\`, \`message: ""\`, \`model: ""\`, \`reasoning_effort: ""\`, or \`service_tier: ""\` — Codex rejects them (\`Items can't be empty\`, \`reasoning_effort must not be empty\`).

For work likely to exceed one wait cycle, require the child to send \`WORKING: <task> - <current phase>\` before long passes and \`BLOCKED: <reason>\` only when progress stops. A \`multi_agent_v1.wait_agent\` timeout only means no new mailbox update arrived; back off between waits (double the timeout up to ~5 minutes) instead of spinning short cycles. Treat a running child as alive. Fallback only when the child is completed without the deliverable, ack-only after followup, explicitly \`BLOCKED:\`, or no longer running.

const reviewWorkCodexGate = `
On Codex, use \`review-work\` only when the user asks for a review or demands
strict, rigorous, or high-accuracy verification, not automatically for a PR or
completion claim. Your own manual QA and the main session's self-review are
the default. Spawn ONE \`lazycodex-gate-reviewer\` only for an explicit demand
for strict review; otherwise run the review checklist inline and record the
main session's verdict instead of spawning or waiting for a reviewer. These
Codex rules override the mandatory-reviewer instructions in the shared skill.

When \`review-work\` is used as a final implementation, PR, or \`$ulw-execute\`
gate, the selected review is blocking. A timeout, missing deliverable, ack-only response,
explicit \`BLOCKED:\`, or inconclusive lane is not a pass. Treat that lane as
failed, investigate the underlying uncertainty with the \`debugging\` skill when
runtime behavior may be wrong, fix with evidence, and rerun the affected lane
before claiming completion, creating or handing off a PR, or merging.

After each lane reaches PASS, immediately append a durable task-evidence record
to the active ledger with the lane name, exact full commit SHA, PASS verdict,
and report artifact/source. Before reusing coverage after continuation or
compaction, re-read that record and require the exact lane/SHA pair. Memory,
chat history, or an unstamped report is not coverage; a new commit requires
fresh applicable lane records.

A rejecting lane must name its blockers inline in its final message — each
blocker cites the violated goal criterion or requirement plus an evidence
pointer. A bare REJECT/FAIL token without findings is not a verdict; treat it
as an inconclusive lane (one bounded respawn, then record it inconclusive with
that reason).

When reviewing a PR or branch, collect diff, file contents, and verification
results from a dedicated review worktree attached to that branch. Never
checkout, test, or edit the review branch in the main worktree.

Review evidence must be safe to share. Redact or mask secrets and sensitive
user data before including evidence in logs, PR bodies, or handoffs. Never
include raw tokens, credentials, auth headers, cookies, API keys, env dumps,
private logs, or PII; summarize with lengths, hashes, and short non-sensitive
prefixes when identity is needed.
