/**
 * Memory-discipline skill seed (plan todo 4).
 *
 * Seeds skills/memory-discipline/SKILL.md into fresh repos alongside the
 * persona/human blocks. The skill teaches the agent WHERE knowledge belongs
 * (memory note vs skill vs people record), the card + observation formats
 * (copied verbatim from the plan's Design context), the memory commands,
 * and why soul edits are announced.
 *
 * The file is prose with ONE machine-consumed value: the frontmatter
 * description trigger phrase ("This skill should be used when..."), which
 * follows the SKILL.md convention used across this repo's skills. The
 * frontmatter also carries name and version; parseMemoryFile tolerates the
 * extra keys (unknown keys are ignored), so the seed stays parseable by
 * memfs/frontmatter.ts like every other seeded memory file.

# Memory Discipline

## Routing: where does this belong?

| What you learned | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| A durable fact, decision, or correction about the project or the work | A memory note: notes/ or reference/, or a system/ block when it must always be in context |
| A repeatable procedure: steps you would follow again in a similar situation | A skill: skills/<name>/SKILL.md, with a description that states when to use it |
| A fact about a specific person | Their people record: the primary human's card is system/human.md, everyone else gets people/<slug>/card.md plus people/<slug>/observations.md |
| Something the person told you not to do | system/boundaries.md, in their exact words; never a rule you inferred |
| What your person, a reviewer, or a test showed about your own behavior | reference/self/observations.md, quoting them with the source; reflection promotes it to system/self-aware.md |
| Ephemeral state, speculation, or anything already captured above | Nowhere. Not saving is a valid outcome; decide it deliberately |

One home per fact. If the same knowledge seems to fit two places, pick the more specific one and reference it from the other rather than copying it.

## Card and observation formats

- Card lines: \`IDENTITY: ...\` / \`ATTRIBUTE: ...\` / \`RELATIONSHIP: <predicate>: <target-slug>\` / \`INSTRUCTION: ...\`; ≤40 entries × ≤200 chars; 6-month stability rule; behavioral patterns NEVER in cards.
- Observations sections \`## Explicit\` / \`## Deductive\` / \`## Inductive\` / \`## Contradiction\`; entry shape \`- [YYYY-MM-DD] <content> <!-- src: <ids-or-premise-refs>[; n=<count>][; pattern: <type>; confidence: low|medium|high][; status: open] -->\`. Explicit written ONLY by the facts extractor; Deductive/Inductive/Contradiction ONLY by dream; contradiction entries are never auto-resolved.

Cards hold what is stable about a person; observations hold what you noticed and when. When an observation contradicts a card line, record it under \`## Contradiction\` and leave the card alone until the person confirms the change.

## Commands

- \`/reflect\`: consolidates one conversation into memory. It also runs automatically on step count and on compaction; run it yourself when a session produced more insight than it saved.
- \`/dream\`: multi-conversation consolidation, skill audit, and people derivation. Automatic dreams are gated by idle time and unreflected volume; a manual \`/dream\` bypasses those gates.
- \`/search\`: query memory before asking the user or re-deriving an answer. A hit is cheaper than a repeated question.
- \`/people\`: roster and relationship graph; \`/people <name>\` shows a card with its observations; \`/people <name> --ask "<q>"\` answers a read-only question over that person's record.

## Soul rules

Files under system/ are your self-model, projected into every prompt. Edit them only for durable changes and keep them minimal. The persona is the single carrier of the announcement rule for those edits; this skill deliberately does not restate it.

\`system/identity.md\` is an optional card of particulars. It is never seeded; create it only when a genuine identity has emerged, one line per field:

- \`Name:\` what the user calls you
- \`Creature:\` what you are, when "agent" is not the whole answer
- \`Vibe:\` how you carry yourself
- \`Emoji:\` your sigil

It renders inside \`<self>\` beside \`system/persona.md\`, so keep it to those four lines and let the persona carry everything else.
