# Senpi Task Delegation

OmO Native (installed through `packages/omo-senpi`) ships a `task` component that lets the agent you are talking to spawn child agents, keep working while they run, steer them, and coordinate a named team. This guide covers the day-to-day surface. The engine internals live in [`packages/senpi-task/AGENTS.md`](../../packages/senpi-task/AGENTS.md); the config file is documented in [`docs/reference/omo-json.md`](../reference/omo-json.md).

The component is on by default. Disable it with the `--no-omo-task` flag; it also self-skips if the Senpi runtime is missing the ExtensionAPI capabilities it needs (`packages/omo-senpi/src/components/task/index.ts`).

## Spawning a child

Use the `task` tool. A single spawn needs `prompt` plus exactly one of `category` (routed to the category worker) or `subagent_type` (a named agent invoked directly); the two are mutually exclusive, and omitting both fails validation (`packages/senpi-task/src/tools/task/validation.ts`). Batch spawns use `tasks:[...]` instead of top-level `prompt`. Prompts are documented as English-only in the schema description, not machine-enforced.

- `run_in_background: false` (default) waits and returns the child's final response inline.
- `run_in_background: true` returns a task id (prefixed `st_`) immediately so you can keep working and check back later.
- `name` gives the child a stable, human-friendly handle within the session so you can steer it by name instead of id.
- `model` is valid only with `subagent_type`; category-routed tasks reject it and resolve their model from category config. `load_skills` prepends named SKILL.md content to the child prompt.
- `subagent_type` must name a loaded agent. A name that is unknown or disabled fails with `unknown_target` listing the available agents; it is never resolved as a category of the same name, so `task(subagent_type="architect")` fails instead of quietly returning the `architect` category's model. Pass `category: "architect"` when a category is what you want.

To continue an existing child with full context instead of spawning a new one, use `task_send` with `to` set to the child id or name.

For fanout, pass `tasks:[...]` instead of the top-level `prompt`/target fields. Each item chooses its own `category` or `subagent_type` and may set `name` and `load_skills`; `model` is available only to items routed by `subagent_type`:

```jsonc
{
  "tasks": [
    { "category": "quick", "prompt": "Check the API contract.", "name": "contract" },
    { "subagent_type": "plan-reviewer", "prompt": "Review the migration risk in the plan.", "name": "risk" }
  ],
  "run_in_background": true
}
```

A synchronous batch waits for every started child and returns one aggregate result. A background batch returns each child id and queue position immediately. If one child cannot start after the batch has been validated, its failure is reported alongside successfully started siblings.

## In-process vs process

Two runners back a child (`packages/senpi-task/src/runners/`):

- **in-process (default).** The child runs inside the same Senpi runtime and executes through the SAME parent tool closures, minus `task`, `task_*`, `team_*`, and `dag` (member-scoped tools are the only sanctioned bypass). This is the cheapest path and needs no extra process.
- **process.** The child is spawned as an isolated Senpi process. Steering (`steer` / `abort` / `prompt`) crosses a JSON-RPC boundary, and the child's transcript is written below `children/<taskId>/sessions/<taskId>/`. On the next session start, a dead process child with a persisted session can be respawned without replaying its original prompt and rebound with `switch_session`.

A process child is itself run one of two ways: as a SESSION of the parent session's own engine host (the default on macOS/Linux, `task.process_runner: "host"`; one host per session, see [omo daemon](../reference/omo-daemon.md)), or as its own OS process (`"child-process"`, and always on Windows).

The default comes from `task.default_execution_mode` in `omo.json`, which ships as `auto`: the parent session asks its own task host ONCE whether it can host children (not Windows, `process_runner: "host"`, and the host advertises `session_context` + `generation_handoff`) and uses `process` when it can, `in-process` when it cannot. A per-agent `execution_mode` and an explicit `in-process`/`process` in `omo.json` both win over that check, and curated read-only agents stay in-process either way. When the host cannot take the children, the reason is reported once per session and shows up in `task_output` as a `host_unavailable:<reason>` note.

Team members always use process mode. Their child process loads a small member extension that owns the member inbox poller and exposes only team-scoped `task_send`.

## Steering, waiting, and stopping

Every control/read tool targets a child by id or by name:

- **`task_send`** always steers a plain-text message into a running child. `to` accepts a child id/name or a team member name. Sending to a finished resident child revives the same session. Structured shutdown messages also route through this tool for lead sessions.
- **`task_output`** immediately returns a child snapshot (`mode:"status"`) or a transcript peek (`mode:"tail"` / `mode:"full"`). It never waits for completion; terminal results arrive through task-completion notifications. Delivered team messages appear as `[team message from <from>] <body>` lines.
- **`task_cancel`** cancels a child terminally and stops its work.

Parent-initiated cancel returns its result synchronously in the tool response and never fires a completion notification.

## Idle parking and message revival

`task.resident_idle_timeout_ms` controls how long an eligible terminal child stays resident without activity. It defaults to **900000 ms (15 minutes)** and accepts positive safe-integer milliseconds only; `0`, fractions, strings, and disable sentinels are invalid. The idle sweep uses the same interval and does not keep the host process alive. Parking occurs on a sweep at or after `updated_at + resident_idle_timeout_ms`, never before it. A send refreshes `updated_at`; running children and children with pending steering are protected.

Idle in-process children park as `persisted_only`; process children, including team members, park as `rpc_detached`. Their live handle is released, not irreversibly evicted. A direct `task_send` to an eligible parked child's task id restores its recorded transcript and launch contract, admits one new run epoch, and reports revival only after delivery acknowledgment. Admission refusal and uncertain delivery are explicit errors; uncertain messages are not automatically replayed. Killed, cancelled, lost, and one-shot children remain non-continuable. Capacity-driven eviction is unchanged.

Parking is independent of `task.ttl_ms` (record and artifact retention, default 86400000 ms) and `task.resume_children` (session-shutdown behavior). Old output remains readable through `task_output` until record expiration. Team-name sends remain durable mailbox writes: a parked process has no active inbox poller, so use its task id for direct revival or resume the owning session before expecting mailbox delivery.

## Inspecting children

- Use **`/tasks`** to list child tasks for the current session or a wider scope.
- Transcript output is capped (`TRANSCRIPT_MAX_CHARS`, `packages/senpi-task/src/tools/output/render.ts`).

## Completion notifications

When a background child finishes on its own - `completed`, `error`, or `lost` - the engine routes a completion to the parent exactly once (`packages/senpi-task/src/completion/routing.ts`):

- Parent **idle**: it is always woken so the completion injects on the parent's next turn. No setting can suppress this.
- Parent **streaming**: the completion is steered into the running turn at the next tool-call boundary. Multiple notifications that become ready in the same batch window (about 200ms) are combined into one injection.
- Parent **compacting / switching / shutting down**: the completion is buffered and flushed once the parent settles.

Because cancel (and interrupt) return synchronously in the tool result, they are never delivered as completion notifications - only externally-caused terminals notify.

## The `/tasks` UI

The component registers two slash commands (`packages/omo-senpi/src/components/task/commands.ts`):

- **`/tasks`** lists this session's tasks; `/tasks --all` lists tasks across every session.
- **`/task-kill`** opens a selector over cancellable tasks (running / pending / interrupted) and cancels the chosen one after a confirm.

A live status widget below the editor tracks the session's tasks as they change; the footer itself stays reserved for the goal indicator.

## Teams

For coordinated multi-agent work, the lead session gets 6 team tools (`packages/senpi-task/src/tools/team/index.ts`): `team_create`, `team_delete`, `task_create`, `task_get`, `task_list`, and `task_update`. These are lead-only. Member sessions receive only team-scoped `task_send`; they never receive team lifecycle or tasklist tools. Lead team messages and shutdown request/response payloads route through `task_send`.

Named teams come from the project `teams` block in `omo.json` or `<project>/.omo/teams/<name>/config.json` (directory spec wins on a name collision); user-global team storage is not loaded. Each team has 1-8 members; a multi-member `omo.json` spec still requires `leadAgentId` in schema, and the current session is always the runtime lead. A member is either `kind: "category"` (needs `category` + `prompt`) or `kind: "subagent_type"` (needs `subagent_type`). See the [teams schema](../reference/omo-json.md#teams).

### Mailbox delivery

`task_send` appends each team message to the recipient's durable inbox and returns immediately. Inbox pollers reserve unread messages and inject them into the recipient session; member delivery uses `pi.sendMessage` with steer delivery, while the lead poller queues the same injection-driven notification path. Each member process polls its own inbox; the lead adapter polls only teams whose persisted `leadSessionId` belongs to the current session. Lead polling runs on session start and every second while the parent is idle or streaming, and pauses during compaction, session switching, and shutdown.

There is no `team_wait` tool. When the next step depends on a reply, send with `task_send`, end the turn, and let the steered team-message notification resume the conversation when the reply arrives. Durable reservation and processed-message state prevent an inbox message from being lost during delivery or restart reconciliation.

## Configuration

### Checkout isolation

The task tool accepts `isolated`, `apply`, and `merge` on a single request or
each batch item. Items inherit omitted values from the top-level request;
explicit `false` wins. `apply` and `merge` are invalid unless isolation is on,
either through `isolated: true` or the setting below. There is no free-form
`cwd` parameter.

An isolated child runs in a copy-on-write clone of the checkout instead of the
checkout itself. When it **completes**, its changes are merged back and the
clone is removed. Any other ending - cancelled, interrupted, failed - merges
nothing and keeps the delta as a patch plus a summary under
`<state dir>/isolation/<task id>/`; a merge that cannot apply cleanly leaves
the workspace beside its original as `<clone>.retained-<timestamp>`. The
outcome rides every result surface as `isolation`, and the completion
notification renders it as `isolation: <kind> via <backend>`.

A repository that cannot be cloned refuses the spawn with
`isolation_unavailable` rather than quietly running the child against the real
checkout, and an isolated child is never revived: once settled its clone is
gone, so `task_send` and startup recovery both answer
`isolated_not_revivable`. If the host dies mid-run, the next session salvages
the clone's delta as artifacts - never an automatic merge - and then reclaims
clones whose owning process is provably gone. DAG nodes and workpool workers
inherit `task.isolation.enabled`; they have no per-node switch of their own.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task.isolation.enabled` | `false` | Opt children into checkout isolation when `isolated` is omitted. |
| `task.isolation.backend` | `auto` | Select `auto`, `apfs`, `btrfs`, `zfs`, `reflink`, `overlayfs`, `block-clone`, or `rcopy`. |
| `task.isolation.apply` | `true` | Merge completed child changes back; `false` keeps patch/branch artifacts only. |
| `task.isolation.merge` | `patch` | Choose patch application or branch integration (`branch`). |
| `task.isolation.commits` | `generic` | Reserved for the commit-message style of a `branch` merge (`ai`). Accepted and validated; no backend consumes it yet, so both values behave as `generic`. |

All defaults live in `omo.json` under `task` and `teams`. A minimal project config:

```jsonc
// .omo/omo.jsonc
{
  "task": {
    "default_execution_mode": "auto",
    "reattach_on_reconcile": true,
    "resident_idle_timeout_ms": 900000,
    "wait": { "default_ms": 90000 }
  }
}
```

The schema default for `task.wait.default_ms` is 60,000 ms; the 90,000 ms value above is only a sample override. Full field reference, defaults, layer precedence, harness blocks, and profile resolution are in [`docs/reference/omo-json.md`](../reference/omo-json.md).

`packages/omo-opencode` is a separate build that still uses its prior task/team names; cross-edition parity is a deliberate follow-up outside this Senpi guide.

## Follow-ups

- The `backendType: "tmux"` member option and user-global team storage are schema-reserved and not yet exercised by the Senpi runtime.
