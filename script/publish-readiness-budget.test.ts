 * Regression pinned (2026-09-04, beta.42): `npm publish` printed "+ omo-ai@5.0.0-0.beta.42" and
 * "Your package is being processed and may take a few minutes to become available", yet the verify
 * step gave up after 5 x 15 s = 60 s and failed the release run - a false failure of a successful
 * publish (the same shape that bit lazycodex-ai in beta.31 and beta.34). The registry showed the
 * version roughly five minutes after publish.
