// How one resident wake ended. A wake is one child turn: the seed or followUp that started it plus
// every steer the turn absorbed. The sidecar aborts a turn itself for three reasons (the tool
// budget, the wake deadline, session shutdown), and none of them is a child failure: only a turn
// the engine settled as an error, or a child that could not be started, counts toward the
// diagnostic streak that eventually raises the `omo-kibitzer:gate` notice - with one exception: a
// start refused because the pinned recall category cannot serve a model (`category_unavailable`,
// or a resolution that only exists beyond the category, which the advisor refuses) is a permanent
// CONFIGURATION state, not a transient failure. It is reported non-diagnostically and answered with
// one actionable `omo-kibitzer:unavailable` notice per session instead of the streak.
