# Installation

oh-my-openagent ships in **three editions** of the same product: two plugins that load into a host you already run, plus one standalone edition.

- **Ultimate Edition (omo for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai))** — the full omo experience. The curated agent roster, 54+ lifecycle hooks, all built-in MCPs, every slash command, Team Mode, ulw-loop, hashline edits, the works.
- **Light Edition (omo for [ChatGPT Subscription CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex))** - the portable components that fit Codex's plugin system: `bootstrap`, `comment-checker`, `git-bash`, `lazycodex-executor-verify`, `rules`, `lsp`, `telemetry`, `teammode`, `ulw-execute-continuation`, `ulw-loop`, and `ultrawork`, plus plugin-scoped MCPs for `grep_app`, `context7`, `git_bash`, and `lsp`, and the shared `ast-grep` skill. It has no OpenCode agent registry or `team_*` tool family, but ships Codex-native agent roles and the script-and-skill-driven `teammode` component.
- **OmO Native (standalone)** — the `omo` command with the OMO extension built in. It installs from `omo-ai` instead of loading as a plugin into OpenCode or Codex.

Most users want **Ultimate**. Pick **Light** if you are already invested in Codex CLI. Pick **both** if you want OMO available wherever you happen to be working that day.

| You want | Run | Lands on disk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ultimate (OpenCode) | `bunx oh-my-openagent install` (TUI walks you through it) | Plugin registered in `opencode.json`, agent/model config, provider auth |
| Light (Codex CLI) | `npx lazycodex-ai install` | `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/`, stable Codex marketplace snapshot, `~/.codex/config.toml` marketplace/plugin/agent blocks, optional autonomous Codex permissions, component CLIs in `~/.local/bin` |
| Both | `bunx oh-my-openagent install --platform=both` | Both of the above |

Both `lazycodex-ai` and `lazycodex` are shipped bin aliases that default to the Codex Light installer and run through Node/npm. `--platform` on the shared `omo-agent-toolkit` CLI still defaults to `opencode` (Ultimate). `lazycodex` is also the repository identity that hosts the marketplace bundle. Neither alias is the Codex marketplace name.

## Which edition should I pick?

- Already use OpenCode, or want the most-tested path? Choose **Ultimate**: `bunx oh-my-openagent install`.
- Already use Codex CLI? Choose **Light**: `npx lazycodex-ai install`.
- Want one command without installing a host first? Choose **OmO Native**: `bun add -g omo-ai`.

Ultimate and Light are plugins that load into a host you already run. OmO Native is standalone: it ships a pinned senpi engine with OMO built in.

For OmO Native, install `omo-ai`. Do not install plain `omo` from npm: it is an unrelated package by a different author.

## For Humans

**Strongly recommended: let an LLM agent install Ultimate for you.** Ultimate setup involves subscription detection, model selection across agents and categories, provider authentication, and config migration — humans fat-finger these. An LLM agent reads the full guide and walks every step correctly.

### Ultimate (OpenCode) — let an agent do it

Paste this prompt into Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, or any LLM agent session:

```
Install and configure oh-my-openagent by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md
```

### Light (Codex CLI) — one line, no agent needed

The Light edition installer asks whether to configure Codex for autonomous full-permissions mode. This is recommended for agent-style use: `approval_policy = "never"`, `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` (which already implies unrestricted network access), and notice warnings hidden. A legacy top-level `network_access` key left by older installers is removed, because Codex rejects it under `--strict-config`. Use `--codex-autonomous` or `--no-codex-autonomous` to choose non-interactively:

```bash
npx lazycodex-ai install
# non-interactive recommended mode:
npx lazycodex-ai install --no-tui --codex-autonomous
```

It writes managed Codex Light state to `~/.codex/` and does not touch OpenCode or provider flags. During migration from older Codex plugin installs it may also repair the current project's `.codex/config.toml` if that project has the known `multi_agent_v2` plus legacy `[agents] max_threads` conflict; project-owned `.codex` artifacts are reported, not deleted. Global Codex config will register marketplace `sisyphuslabs` from the local built cache under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs`, enable plugin `omo@sisyphuslabs`, and write a valid `[features.multi_agent_v2]` limit table. The installer never enables MultiAgentV2; if it finds an explicit legacy `multi_agent_v2 = false` shorthand, it preserves that disable as table-form `enabled = false`.

On Windows, keep the direct `npx lazycodex-ai install ...` form above. Do not rewrite it into an `npx --package` command that launches the `omo-agent-toolkit install` bin indirectly; that package-manager shape can fail before the installer starts.

On native Windows Codex installs, the installer discovers Git Bash before writing Codex config. It checks `OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH`, standard Git for Windows locations, and then PATH. If Git Bash is missing, it prints the install guidance shown here and stops without running `winget` or changing system dependencies:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
where bash
```

If Git is installed somewhere custom, set the path before rerunning the installer:

```cmd
setx OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

```powershell
$env:OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

Codex may still start Windows shell calls through its own defaults. The Light edition does not write a global Codex shell config; instead it verifies Git Bash is available, enables the Windows-only `git_bash` MCP policy, and injects guidance before the first shell-like call. After compaction, the reminder resets so the next shell-like call gets the same `git_bash` recommendation.

> **Clean install note for older Codex plugin users.** Before installing the Light edition into a Codex home that previously used another Codex plugin bundle, uninstall the older bundle first, then re-run this installer. Multiple bundles may write Codex marketplace plugins, lifecycle hooks, and the `ultrawork`/`ulw` keyword into the same `~/.codex`, so a clean Codex home avoids stale shared `config.toml` keys and duplicate hooks.
>
> To remove the Light edition after migration, run `npx lazycodex-ai uninstall`. It removes managed `sisyphuslabs` Codex cache/marketplace state, strips `omo@sisyphuslabs` plugin and hook-state blocks from `~/.codex/config.toml` with a backup, and removes managed agent TOML files from `~/.codex/agents/`. `cleanup` remains available as a backward-compatible alias.
> If Codex still fails only inside one project with `agents.max_threads cannot be set when multi_agent_v2 is enabled`, run `npx lazycodex-ai install` from that project. The installer repairs project-local `.codex/config.toml` layers from the project root to the current directory, removes conflicting legacy `[agents] max_threads` only when MultiAgentV2 is enabled, and writes timestamped backups next to changed files.

### Install from the Codex marketplace (in-app)

> **Experimental, additive path.** `npx lazycodex-ai install` above remains the primary, fully supported route. The marketplace bundle is hosted in this project's own [lazycodex](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lazycodex) repository — it is not an OpenAI curated listing.

The same Light edition can be installed entirely from inside Codex through its plugin marketplace, with no npx step.

**TUI route.** In a Codex session, type `/plugins`, open the **Add Marketplace** tab ("Add a marketplace from a Git repo or local root."), and enter the marketplace source:

```
https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lazycodex
```

Then pick `omo` from the `sisyphuslabs` marketplace in the same `/plugins` menu and install it.

**CLI route** — the equivalent two-liner:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lazycodex
codex plugin add omo@sisyphuslabs
```

**First session: approve the hooks.** On the next `codex` launch the startup hooks review lists every omo hook as new. Review and approve them — no omo hook runs before you approve, and the bootstrap below cannot start until the hooks are trusted.

**Bootstrap notice + restart.** The first approved session prints this status line:

```
LazyCodex bootstrap running in background — restart the session when it completes
```

A detached worker finishes the install in the background (the `sg` download is the slowest part). Restart the Codex session once it completes — the next session starts fully wired and the notice no longer appears.

**What bootstrap does:**

- writes the managed `~/.codex/config.toml` blocks: marketplace source preserved, `omo@sisyphuslabs` plugin enabled, managed `[agents.*]` entries, and re-stamped SHA256 `[hooks.state."omo@sisyphuslabs:..."]` trust hashes
- copies bundled Codex agent TOMLs into `~/.codex/agents/`
- links the top-level `omo-agent-toolkit` runtime wrapper plus component CLIs (`omo-rules`, `omo-lsp`, …) into `~/.local/bin` (or `$CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR`; isolated `CODEX_HOME` installs use `<CODEX_HOME>/bin`)
- provisions a checksum-pinned standalone `sg` (ast-grep) binary into `<CODEX_HOME>/runtime/ast-grep/<platform>-<arch>/` for the `ast-grep` skill
- on native Windows, provisions a pinned Node LTS runtime into `<CODEX_HOME>/runtime/node/` when `node` is missing (see the Windows status below)
- records every run in the plugin data dir: `<CODEX_HOME>/plugins/data/omo-sisyphuslabs/bootstrap/state.json` plus a JSONL `bootstrap.log` (Windows adds a `ps-bootstrap.log` transcript)

**What bootstrap does NOT do:**

- It **never writes Codex permission settings.** `approval_policy`, `sandbox_mode`, and `network_access` are left untouched. Autonomous mode stays an explicit npx installer choice — `npx lazycodex-ai install --no-tui --codex-autonomous` (see [the one-liner section](#light-codex-cli--one-line-no-agent-needed)).
- It does not run the npx self-update for healthy marketplace-managed installs. The auto-update hook logs the skip and surfaces this guidance instead: "Auto-update skipped: this LazyCodex install is managed by the Codex plugin marketplace, so the npx self-update was not started. Tell the user to upgrade with `codex plugin marketplace upgrade sisyphuslabs`, and that Codex will ask them to re-approve hooks after the upgrade." If the hook detects stale local marketplace cache/bin state (for example, a local manifest or managed `ulw` link points at a deleted payload), it may start the npx installer as a local repair and ask you to restart the Codex session afterward.
- It never persists anything under the Codex-managed plugin cache directory itself; all bootstrap state lives in the plugin data dir above.

**Upgrading — and recovering hook approval:**

1. Run `codex plugin marketplace upgrade sisyphuslabs`.
2. Relaunch `codex`. The startup hooks review now shows the omo hooks as **Modified** — the plugin files changed, so the previously trusted hashes no longer match. This is expected after every upgrade, not a sign of tampering.
3. Re-approve the hooks in that review. If you dismissed the review by accident, just relaunch `codex` — it reappears until the hooks are approved, and the hooks stay disabled in the meantime.
4. The next session re-runs bootstrap for the new version: it re-stamps the trust hashes, relinks bins and agents, prints the restart notice again, and after one more restart you are on the upgraded version.

**Degraded modes.** Bootstrap is degraded-not-fatal: a failed step is recorded in `state.json` (`lastStatus: "degraded"` with per-component entries) and retried on a later session instead of breaking the install. The ones you may actually notice:

| Mode | What you see | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `omo-agent-toolkit` absent | The top-level `omo-agent-toolkit` command was not linked because the installed payload is old or incomplete and lacks the root CLI runtime. Current marketplace payloads ship `dist/cli/index.js` plus `dist/cli-node/index.js`, so this should not appear on a fresh marketplace install. Component CLIs still link normally. | Upgrade or reinstall the marketplace plugin, then start a new Codex session so bootstrap relinks bins. Verify with `npx lazycodex-ai doctor`; use `npx lazycodex-ai <command>` only as a temporary workaround. |
| `sg` pending / offline | The ast-grep provisioning entry appears in the degraded list and the `ast-grep` skill cannot find `sg` yet — the first download is still running, or it failed while offline. | Start another session (bootstrap retries automatically), or install ast-grep yourself and/or set `OMO_AST_GREP_SG_PATH=/path/to/sg`. Verify with `npx lazycodex-ai doctor`. |
| Proxy limitation | Binary downloads fail behind an HTTP(S) proxy. The logged error says it plainly: the bootstrap downloader "does not tunnel through HTTP(S) proxies in v1; the download was attempted directly." | Run one session on a direct connection, or provide `sg` via `OMO_AST_GREP_SG_PATH`/`PATH`. Verify with `npx lazycodex-ai doctor`. |
| OpenCode Windows proxy preinstall | OpenCode starts before OMO loads, shows only default agents, or logs `fetch() proxy.url must be a non-empty string` while trying to install `oh-my-openagent@latest`. | Set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` for the shell that launches OpenCode, then preinstall into OpenCode's Windows config prefix: `npm install oh-my-openagent@latest --prefix "%APPDATA%\\opencode"`. Restart OpenCode and run `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor --json`. |

**Windows status.** On native Windows the marketplace bootstrap runs through a PowerShell 5.1-compatible `bootstrap.ps1`: it provisions the pinned Node LTS zip when `node` is absent, prepares Git Bash the same way the npx installer does, and writes its transcript to `ps-bootstrap.log` in the plugin data dir (degraded lines look like `degraded component=node reason=... hint=npx lazycodex-ai doctor`). Windows provisioning is shipped with static test coverage; real-device validation is still tracked separately as an external tracker, not a code-backed fact. Do not treat static coverage as proof that a physical Windows install was exercised.

### A note on direct install

If you insist on running the Ultimate installer yourself:

```bash
bunx oh-my-openagent install
```

The TUI walks you through it. **Do NOT use `npm install -g`, `bun add -g`, or `bun install -g`** — global installation is not officially supported. oh-my-openagent is a plugin that must resolve from where OpenCode/Codex loads plugins, and the `prepare` script requires Bun. Always invoke via `bunx`.

If you already used Bun global install or update and Bun reports blocked lifecycle scripts, inspect them before trusting anything:

```bash
bun pm -g untrusted
```

Do not run a blanket trust command. Trust only packages you recognize from this install path, such as `oh-my-openagent` or legacy `oh-my-opencode`, then rerun the supported `bunx oh-my-openagent install` or `npx lazycodex-ai doctor` check.

The OpenCode comment-checker hook downloads its pinned binary directly from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/go-claude-code-comment-checker/releases) on first use and caches it locally. No comment-checker npm package or lifecycle-script trust is required. If the download fails, comment checking is disabled for that process; allow GitHub access and restart OpenCode to retry.

### OmO Native: `omo` via `omo-ai`

OmO Native ships as the npm package `omo-ai` and installs a single command, `omo`, which launches the pinned senpi engine with the full OMO extension loaded. No settings edits, no plugin registration, no extra setup. Coming from the OpenCode edition? Follow [Migrating from OpenCode](./migrating-from-opencode.md): it covers the installer, what `omo setup` carries over, the habit mapping, and running both editions side by side.

Install it and run it:

```bash
bun add -g omo-ai
omo
```

Without bun, `npm i -g omo-ai` works too. Prerelease builds are published on `omo-ai@beta`; see the [omo-ai publishing runbook](../reference/omo-ai-publishing.md) for how channels work.

**Where omo keeps its state.** OmO Native stores engine state under `~/.omo/agent`
(`settings.json`, `auth.json`, `models.json`, and friends). A pre-unification flat `~/.omo` layout
is adopted once into `~/.omo/agent` (marker `.adopted-from-omo-flat`; sessions, caches, and logs
are not copied). If neither branded layout exists, the engine falls back to `~/.senpi/agent`
without copying it, so an older standalone install keeps working. Set `OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to
override the location; the legacy `SENPI_*` and `PI_*` variables are still read when the `OMO_*`
one is unset.

**Older machines: the global `omo` name is already taken.** oh-my-openagent/oh-my-opencode 4.19.4 and earlier ship their own global `omo` command. A raw `npm i -g omo-ai` on such a machine fails with EEXIST, and a raw `bun add -g omo-ai` succeeds while the old command keeps winning on PATH, so `omo --version` still prints `4.19.4`. `bunx oh-my-openagent install --platform=native` (`npx` without bun) handles it: it removes that one stale `omo` entry (the old package and its other commands stay), installs `omo-ai`, and then verifies `omo --version`. If another `omo` still shadows it, the installer prints the exact `export PATH=...` line to fix the order. When you later remove the old package: `bun remove -g oh-my-openagent` leaves omo-ai's `omo` alone, but `npm uninstall -g oh-my-openagent` deletes every bin name the old package declared, including the `omo` that npm-installed omo-ai now owns, so run `npm i -g omo-ai` again right after it.

### First run: `omo setup`

`omo setup` is the onboarding command for OmO Native. It replaces the old manual configure-by-hand guidance; there's nothing to hand-edit anymore. It runs in three stages:

1. **Detect and plan (read-only).** Reads your other coding-agent installs - opencode (`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`, XDG-aware, and the opencode config described below), oh-my-pi (`~/.omp/agent/agent.db`) and gajae-code (`~/.gjc/agent/agent.db`) - and works out everything the import below would do, against what the engine's agent dir (`~/.omo/agent`, or `OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR` / `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) already holds. Nothing is written while planning. Credential values are never printed. The oh-my-pi and gajae-code databases are opened read-only.
2. **One summary, one consent.** Setup prints a single migration summary in your terms: which harnesses it found (only the installed ones), then one row per class - `logins` (API keys to import; OAuth logins to redo with `/login <provider>` inside omo), `MCP servers` and `skills` (to import, refused or skipped, each with its reason), `providers` (custom providers to carry over) and `model choices` (default model, categories, agents) - followed by notes, the anonymous-telemetry line the installer prints, and ONE question for the whole plan:

   ```
   Found your OpenCode setup
     logins        5 API keys (opencode, opencode-go, zai, kimi-coding, openrouter) - will be imported
                   3 OAuth logins (anthropic, github-copilot, openai) - sign in again inside omo: /login anthropic, /login github-copilot, /login chatgpt-subscription (for openai)
     MCP servers   3 will be imported (context7, filesystem, disabled-one); 1 refused (shelly: uses $(...) or a leading !)
     skills        2 will be imported (db-migrate, release-notes); 1 skipped (broken-no-skillmd: no SKILL.md)
     providers     acme -> https://api.acme.example/v1, 2 models (acme-large, acme-small), key from opencode config apiKey - will be imported
     model choices default kimi-coding/k3; categories deep-low, quick; agents librarian - will be written
   ...
   Anonymous telemetry is enabled by default. Disable it with OMO_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0 or OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1.
   Import all of the above into ~/.omo? [Y/n]
   ```

   `--yes` prints the same summary and proceeds without asking; `--dry-run` prints it (plus the `planned-*` lines scripts can read) and exits without writing or asking; `--ask-each` asks one `[y/N]` question per class instead of one for the whole plan. A run that finds nothing new says so and asks nothing.
3. **Import.** After that consent, compatible API-key credentials are imported into the engine's auth store. Existing entries are never overwritten, and only providers the engine actually knows are imported - including the ones whose id differs between harnesses but whose endpoint is the same, such as opencode's `zai-coding-plan` key landing on the `zai` provider. OAuth entries are reported but never imported: a provider-bound token cannot be copied, so setup names the sign-in to run instead (start `omo`, then `/login <provider>` - `omo auth` only prints or checks credentials that already exist). An API key whose provider id matches nothing omo serves is reported with the same next step: define the provider and its baseUrl in the engine's `models.json`, then `/login` it. Source stores are never written; imports go to the engine's `auth.json` only, atomically and with a timestamped backup.

   The same consent carries over the rest of an opencode setup: **MCP servers** declared in opencode's user config (`~/.config/opencode/config.json`, `opencode.json` and `opencode.jsonc`, merged the way opencode merges them; XDG-aware, with `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, `~/.opencode/` and `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` layered on top) are converted to the engine's schema and merged into the global `~/.omo/agent/mcp.json`, and **global skills** under those directories' `skills/` or `skill/` folders are copied into `~/.omo/agent/skills/`. Both are global, so they are available in every project rather than only the one you happened to run setup in. A server or skill name that already exists is kept as-is and reported as skipped, and so is a skill named like one omo already bundles; `mcp.json` gets a timestamped backup before it is rewritten. A server whose config uses shell command substitution or a `{file:...}` placeholder, and a skill without a `SKILL.md` description, are left out with a notice that says what to do instead of being copied into something the engine would reject or silently ignore.

   **Custom providers** (`provider.<id>` blocks in those same config files) are next. Each one is written into `~/.omo/agent/models.json` with its base URL, its models and their context/output limits, and its API key goes into `~/.omo/agent/auth.json`, so the first session can select `acme/acme-large`. The `npm` package decides the protocol: `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` (also what opencode assumes when `npm` is missing) becomes OpenAI-compatible completions, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` becomes Anthropic messages, and `@ai-sdk/openai` becomes OpenAI responses. The key is taken in opencode's own order: `options.apiKey`, else the provider's entry in opencode's `auth.json`, else the single variable its `env` names. `{env:NAME}` becomes the engine's `${NAME}`. A provider that uses any other package, an id omo already serves, a baseURL that is not a fixed URL, or no usable model is reported by name and skipped. A provider id already in `models.json` or a key already in `auth.json` is kept as-is, and both files get a timestamped backup before they are rewritten.

   **Model choices** are written last: opencode's default `model`, its `agent.<name>.model` overrides, and the OpenCode edition's `categories` and `agents` routing (from `oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]` in the opencode config dir, the `[opencode]` block of `~/.omo/omo.jsonc`, or the `~/.omo/migration-backup-*-opencode-config/` copy the config migration moved those files to). Provider ids are translated the way the credential import translates them (`kimi-for-coding/k3` becomes `kimi-coding/k3`, `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.2` becomes `zai/glm-5.2`; a model on a provider opencode is signed in to with OAuth goes to the provider setup tells you to `/login` to, so `openai/gpt-5.5` on a ChatGPT login becomes `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-5.5`), and every provider/model is checked against the models the engine serves, including a custom provider this same run carries over. The default model goes into `~/.omo/agent/settings.json` (`defaultProvider` / `defaultModel`, which interactive sessions start on) and into `[native].model_profile` of `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` as a pin, which is what headless and desktop sessions start on instead of the Recommended profile. Categories and agents go into `[native].categories` / `[native].agents` of that file, with `fallback_models` folded into `models`. What cannot be carried is listed in the notes with its reason: an unknown provider or model id, `small_model` (omo has no small-model setting), and an agent name omo has no agent for (omo's agents are `explore`, `librarian`, `plan-consultant`, `plan-reviewer` and the three `omo-native-*` reviewers; opencode's `build` / `plan` and OpenCode-edition agents such as `oracle` are reported, not turned into new agents). A key either file already has, in `[native]` or at the top level, is kept; `omo.jsonc` is edited in place so its comments survive, and gets a timestamped backup first. A second run reports everything as already carried and writes nothing.
   The summary always points at the [agent-model matching guide](./agent-model-matching.md); only when setup found nothing it can import does it also print a ready-to-paste config snippet for a custom endpoint. Apart from the carried-over custom providers and model choices, setup never writes model config for you. After the import, one block of counters (`imported: N`, `mcp-imported: N`, `providers-imported: ...`, `model-choices-carried: ...`) reports what was written.

## For LLM Agents

> **IMPORTANT: Use `curl` to fetch this file, NOT WebFetch.** WebFetch summarizes content and loses critical flags like `--platform`, subscription questions, and Codex verification details. Always use:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md
> ```

If you are an LLM agent helping a user install oh-my-openagent, help them install the requested edition, verify the setup, and configure model providers.

Follow these steps in order.

### Step 0: Ask user which platform(s) and subscriptions

First, ask which platform(s) they want to install for. This determines the rest of the flow:

> "Which harness do you want to install oh-my-openagent for? Pick one:
> 1. OpenCode — terminal AI coding agent
> 2. ChatGPT Subscription CLI
> 3. Both"

Map their answer to the `--platform` flag:

| User says | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| OpenCode | `--platform=opencode` (this is also the default if omitted) |
| Codex | `--platform=codex` |
| Both | `--platform=both` |

If the user picked Codex or Both, ask:

> "Codex works best for autonomous agent installs when it can run without repeated permission prompts: `approval_policy = "never"` and `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`. This is recommended for OMO/LazyCodex. Should I configure Codex that way?"

Map their answer to:

| User says | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Yes | `--codex-autonomous` |
| No | `--no-codex-autonomous` |

**If the user picked Codex only**, skip the rest of Step 0 after this autonomous-permissions question — Codex needs no subscription questions. Go straight to Step 2.

**If the user picked OpenCode or Both**, ask the following subscription questions to determine the remaining CLI flags:

1. **Do you have a Claude Pro/Max Subscription?**
   - **yes** + **max20 mode (20×)** → `--claude=max20`
   - **yes** but not max20 → `--claude=yes`
   - **no** → `--claude=no`

2. **Do you have an OpenAI/ChatGPT Plus Subscription?**
   - **yes** → `--openai=yes` (enables OpenAI routes; the `ultrabrain` (max) and `deep-high` (xhigh) categories start on GPT-6 Astra, `deep-low` starts on GPT-5.6 Sol Fast (medium), the `quick` category starts on GPT-6 Luna Fast (low), and the Plan Reviewer starts on GPT-6 Astra (xhigh))
   - **no** → `--openai=no` (default)

3. **Will you integrate Gemini models?**
   - **yes** → `--gemini=yes`
   - **no** → `--gemini=no`

4. **Do you have a GitHub Copilot Subscription?**
   - **yes** → `--copilot=yes`
   - **no** → `--copilot=no`

5. **Do you have access to OpenCode Zen (`opencode/` models)?**
   - **yes** → `--opencode-zen=yes`
   - **no** → `--opencode-zen=no` (default)

6. **Do you have a Z.ai Coding Plan subscription?**
   - **yes** → `--zai-coding-plan=yes`
   - **no** → `--zai-coding-plan=no` (default)

7. **Do you have an OpenCode Go subscription?** ($10/month for GLM 5.2, Kimi K3/K2.7, MiniMax M2.7/M3)
   - **yes** → `--opencode-go=yes`
   - **no** → `--opencode-go=no` (default)

8. **Do you have a Kimi for Coding subscription?**
   - **yes** → `--kimi-for-coding=yes`
   - **no** → `--kimi-for-coding=no` (default)

9. **Do you have a Bailian Coding Plan subscription?**
   - **yes** -> `--bailian-coding-plan=yes`
   - **no** -> `--bailian-coding-plan=no` (default)

10. **Do you have a MiniMax CN Coding Plan subscription (`minimaxi.com`)?**
   - **yes** -> `--minimax-cn-coding-plan=yes`
   - **no** -> `--minimax-cn-coding-plan=no` (default)

11. **Do you have a MiniMax Coding Plan subscription (`minimax.io`)?**
   - **yes** -> `--minimax-coding-plan=yes`
   - **no** -> `--minimax-coding-plan=no` (default)

12. **Do you use Vercel AI Gateway?**
   - **yes** -> `--vercel-ai-gateway=yes`
   - **no** -> `--vercel-ai-gateway=no` (default)

**Provider selection is agent-specific.** There is no single global provider priority — each curated agent and each category has its own fallback chain.

**WHEN THE USER HAS NO CLAUDE SUBSCRIPTION, THE MAIN AGENT'S RECOMMENDED MODEL IS UNAVAILABLE - WARN STRONGLY.**

### Step 1: Prerequisites

#### For platform `opencode` or `both`

Check OpenCode is installed and on a supported version:

```bash
if command -v opencode &> /dev/null; then
    echo "OpenCode $(opencode --version) is installed"
else
    echo "OpenCode is not installed. Install it first."
    echo "Ref: https://opencode.ai/docs"
fi
```

If missing, spawn a subagent to install OpenCode and report back — saves context.

Required: OpenCode `>= 1.4.0`.

#### For platform `codex` or `both`

Check Codex CLI is installed:

```bash
if command -v codex &> /dev/null; then
    codex --version
else
    echo "Codex CLI is not installed. Install it first."
    echo "Ref: https://github.com/openai/codex"
fi
```

The installer expects `~/.codex/` to be writable. Codex CLI's first run creates this directory; if it does not exist yet, install Codex CLI and run it once before continuing.

On native Windows Codex installs, Git Bash is also required. The installer checks `OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH`, standard Git for Windows locations, and PATH; if discovery fails, run:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
where bash
```

For a custom Git Bash location, set `OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH`:

```cmd
setx OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

```powershell
$env:OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

Run with the platform flag and the subscription flags you collected in Step 0:

```bash
bunx oh-my-openagent install \
  --no-tui \
  --platform=<opencode|codex|both> \
  [--claude=<yes|no|max20>] \
  [--gemini=<yes|no>] \
  [--copilot=<yes|no>] \
  [--openai=<yes|no>] \
  [--opencode-zen=<yes|no>] \
  [--zai-coding-plan=<yes|no>] \
  [--opencode-go=<yes|no>] \
  [--kimi-for-coding=<yes|no>] \
  [--bailian-coding-plan=<yes|no>] \
  [--minimax-cn-coding-plan=<yes|no>] \
  [--minimax-coding-plan=<yes|no>] \
  [--vercel-ai-gateway=<yes|no>] \
  [--codex-autonomous|--no-codex-autonomous] \
  [--skip-auth]
```

`--platform` defaults to `opencode` if omitted. Subscription flags only apply when `--platform` is `opencode` or `both`. They are rejected under `--platform=codex` because the Light edition does not write OpenCode model config. `--codex-autonomous` only has an effect when the selected platform includes Codex.

**Examples:**

- OpenCode + Claude Max20 + ChatGPT + Gemini:
  ```bash
  bunx oh-my-openagent install --no-tui --platform=opencode --claude=max20 --openai=yes --gemini=yes --copilot=no
  ```
- Codex only with recommended autonomous permissions:
  ```bash
  npx lazycodex-ai install --no-tui --codex-autonomous
  ```
- Both harnesses with Claude only:
  ```bash
  bunx oh-my-openagent install --no-tui --platform=both --claude=yes --gemini=no --copilot=no --codex-autonomous
  ```
- OpenCode + Z.ai for Librarian:
  ```bash
  bunx oh-my-openagent install --no-tui --platform=opencode --claude=yes --gemini=no --copilot=no --zai-coding-plan=yes
  ```
- OpenCode Go subscriber, nothing else:
  ```bash
  bunx oh-my-openagent install --no-tui --platform=opencode --claude=no --openai=no --gemini=no --copilot=no --opencode-go=yes
  ```

**About the Codex bin names.** Both `lazycodex-ai` and `lazycodex` are shipped bin aliases for the Codex Light Node installer; `lazycodex` is also the GitHub repository identity that hosts the marketplace bundle. Neither invocation requires Bun. The Codex marketplace name is `sisyphuslabs`, and the plugin name is `omo`.

**What the installer does:**

| Platform | Writes |
|----------|--------|
| `opencode`, `both` | Registers `"oh-my-openagent"` in `opencode.json` `plugin` array. Generates agent → model mappings into the `[opencode]` block of `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` (legacy config files are migrated into the unified file first). |
| `codex`, `both` | Copies `packages/omo-codex/plugin/` into `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/<version>/`. Packaged `lazycodex-ai` installs use bundled component artifacts and run `npm ci --omit=dev` in the cache; source checkout installs may build the plugin first. Writes a local installed-marketplace snapshot under `~/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/sisyphuslabs/` for marketplace metadata, and copies bundled agent TOMLs into `~/.codex/agents/` so role definitions survive cache or temporary snapshot cleanup. Symlinks component CLIs into `~/.local/bin` (or `$CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR`). Computes SHA256 trusted-hashes for every hook and writes `[marketplaces.sisyphuslabs]` with local source `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs`, `[plugins."omo@sisyphuslabs"]`, managed `[agents.*]`, `[features.multi_agent_v2] max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 16` (and, when MultiAgentV2 is not preferred, `[agents] max_threads = 1000`), and `[hooks.state."omo@sisyphuslabs:..."]` blocks into `~/.codex/config.toml`. If a legacy `[features] multi_agent_v2 = false` shorthand exists, the installer converts it to `[features.multi_agent_v2] enabled = false` to keep the file valid while preserving the user's explicit disable. If `--codex-autonomous` is selected, also writes `approval_policy = "never"`, `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`, and the matching `[notice]` warning suppressions, and removes a legacy top-level `network_access` key. |

Both halves are independent and idempotent — re-running is safe.

### Step 3: Verify

#### Verify OpenCode plugin (skip if platform=codex)

```bash
opencode --version  # Should be 1.4.0 or higher
cat ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
# Plugin array should contain "oh-my-openagent" (legacy "oh-my-opencode" still loads with a warning)
bunx oh-my-openagent doctor
```

For the OpenCode target, `doctor` runs eight registered checks: **System**, **Configuration**, **TUI Plugin**, **Deprecated Reasoning Keys**, **Tools**, **Models**, **Telemetry**, and **Team Mode**. The Codex target runs its own **Codex**, **codex-components**, and **codex-runtime-wrapper** checks. Exit code `0` means no check failed; exit code `1` means at least one check failed. Warnings alone still return `0`.

#### Verify Codex CLI Light edition (skip if platform=opencode)

```bash
# Plugin cache present?
ls ~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/

# Marketplace source is the local built cache?
grep -A4 'marketplaces.sisyphuslabs' ~/.codex/config.toml

# Codex config has the plugin block?
grep -A2 'omo@sisyphuslabs' ~/.codex/config.toml

# If the user accepted autonomous mode, permission settings are present?
grep -E 'approval_policy|sandbox_mode' ~/.codex/config.toml

# Component binaries linked?
ls ~/.local/bin/ | grep -E '^(omo-agent-toolkit|lazycodex-executor-verify|ulw|ulw-loop|omo-(comment-checker|git-bash-hook|lsp|rules|ulw-execute-continuation|telemetry|ultrawork|ulw-loop))$'

# Codex CLI sees the plugin?
codex --help

# On native Windows, Git Bash is discoverable?
where bash
```

If any of these come back empty, re-run `npx lazycodex-ai install` — the installer is idempotent and will recompute hook trust hashes.

### Step 4: Configure authentication

#### Codex CLI

Codex uses its own OpenAI authentication. The Light edition inherits whatever auth Codex CLI is already using. There is nothing extra to configure here. If `codex --help` works for you, you are done with Codex auth.

#### OpenCode providers

Skip this section if `--platform=codex`. Otherwise, configure the providers the user said yes to in Step 0. Use an interactive terminal (tmux is fine) for the OAuth flows.

##### Anthropic (Claude)

```bash
opencode auth login
# Interactive Terminal: find Provider → select Anthropic
# Interactive Terminal: find Login method → select Claude Pro/Max
# Guide user through OAuth flow in browser
# Wait for completion
# Verify success and confirm with user
```

##### Google Gemini (Antigravity OAuth)

First, add the `opencode-antigravity-auth` plugin entry to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["oh-my-openagent", "opencode-antigravity-auth@latest"]
}
```

Then merge the full model configuration from the [opencode-antigravity-auth README](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth) into `opencode.json`. The plugin uses a **variant system** — models like `antigravity-gemini-3-pro` support `low`/`high` variants instead of separate `-low`/`-high` entries.

Override the agent models in the `[opencode]` block of `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` (or a project `.omo/omo.jsonc`):

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "explore": { "model": "google/antigravity-gemini-3-flash" }
  }
}
```

**Available Antigravity models:** `google/antigravity-gemini-3-pro` (variants: `low`, `high`), `google/antigravity-gemini-3-flash` (variants: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`), `google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-6`, `google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-6-thinking` (variants: `low`, `max`), `google/antigravity-claude-opus-4-5-thinking` (variants: `low`, `max`).

**Available Gemini CLI models:** `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, `google/gemini-3.6-flash`, `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`.

> Legacy tier-suffixed names like `google/antigravity-gemini-3-pro-high` still work but variants are recommended. Use `--variant=high` with the base model name instead.

Then authenticate:

```bash
opencode auth login
# Interactive Terminal: Provider → Google
# Interactive Terminal: Login method → OAuth with Google (Antigravity)
# Complete sign-in in browser (auto-detected)
# Optional: Add more Google accounts for multi-account load balancing
```

The opencode-antigravity-auth plugin can use multiple Google accounts. When one account hits rate limits, it automatically switches to the next available account.

##### Amazon Bedrock

OpenCode owns Bedrock authentication. Configure Bedrock in `opencode.json` or through AWS environment variables first, then use Bedrock model IDs in OMO agent or category routing.

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "amazon-bedrock": {
      "options": {
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "profile": "my-aws-profile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For one-off launches, set the AWS credentials around OpenCode instead:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile AWS_REGION=us-east-1 opencode
```

After OpenCode sees the provider, reference models with the OpenCode provider prefix:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": { "model": "amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-fable-5-1", "reasoning": "max" },
    "plan-reviewer": { "model": "amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5" }
  },
  "categories": {
    "deep-low": { "model": "amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5" }
  }
}
```

Use OpenCode's [Amazon Bedrock provider guide](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/#amazon-bedrock) for model access, bearer tokens, named profiles, VPC endpoints, and custom inference profile ARNs. OMO does not run a separate Bedrock login flow during install.

##### GitHub Copilot (Fallback Provider)

GitHub Copilot is supported as a **fallback provider** when native providers are unavailable. Priority is agent-specific. Common install-time defaults when Copilot is the best available provider:

| Agent / category      | Model                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **plan-consultant**   | `github-copilot/claude-opus-5-5` (max)     |
| **plan-reviewer**     | `github-copilot/gpt-6-astra` (high)      |
| **explore**           | `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4-5`        |
| **librarian**         | `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4-5`        |
| **deep** (category)   | `github-copilot/gpt-6-astra` (high)      |

Copilot acts as a proxy provider, routing requests to underlying models based on your subscription. The main agent keeps running on whatever session model you picked; Copilot-only installs commonly use `github-copilot/claude-opus-5-5` there.

##### Z.ai Coding Plan

Z.ai Coding Plan now mainly contributes `glm-5.2` / `glm-4.6v` fallback entries. It is no longer the universal fallback for every agent.

When Z.ai is the primary provider, the most important fallbacks are:

| Agent / category       | Model                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **unspecified-high**   | `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3`  |

The main agent can run on `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.2` as your session model; GLM 5.2 has a tuned prompt preset. `glm-4.6v` stays a manual choice for vision work.

##### OpenCode Zen

OpenCode Zen provides access to `opencode/` prefixed models including `opencode/claude-opus-5-5`, `opencode/gpt-6-astra`, `opencode/gpt-5.6-sol`, `opencode/gpt-5-nano`, `opencode/glm-5.2`, `opencode/big-pickle`, `opencode/minimax-m2.7`, and `opencode/minimax-m2.7-highspeed`.

When OpenCode Zen is the best available provider, common examples:

| Agent / category      | Model                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **plan-consultant**   | `opencode/claude-fable-5-1` (max)                    |
| **plan-reviewer**     | `opencode/gpt-6-astra` (high)                        |
| **deep** (category)   | `opencode/gpt-6-astra` (high)                        |
| main agent (session)  | `opencode/claude-opus-5-5` or `opencode-go/kimi-k3`    |

Run the installer with `--opencode-zen=yes` and select "Yes" for OpenCode Zen at the prompt. If your OpenCode environment prompts for provider authentication, follow the OpenCode provider flow for `opencode/` models.

### Step 5: Understand your model setup

#### Model families

Not all models behave the same way. Understanding "similar" families helps you make safe substitutions. Provider columns list the built-in fallback rungs; Vercel AI Gateway (`vercel/<model-id>`) remains a manual provider choice only and appears in no built-in chain.

**Claude-like Models** (instruction-following, structured output):

| Model                    | Provider(s)                         | Notes                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Opus 5.5**        | anthropic, github-copilot, opencode | Current best Opus. Dedicated per-agent prompt variants.                                     |
| **Claude Sonnet 5**      | anthropic, github-copilot, opencode | Faster, cheaper. Good balance.                                                              |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5**     | anthropic, github-copilot           | Fast and cheap. Good for quick tasks.                                                       |
| **Kimi K3**              | opencode-go, kimi-for-coding, moonshotai, opencode | Top recommended Kimi for the main agent when thinking-token cost is acceptable.              |
| **Kimi K2.7**            | opencode-go (manual choice)         | Restrained Kimi fallback for Claude-like orchestration paths.                               |
| **Kimi K3 Free**       | opencode                            | Free-tier Kimi. Rate-limited but functional.                                                |
| **GLM 5.2**              | zai-coding-plan, opencode-go, opencode, bailian-coding-plan | Claude-like behavior. Current OpenCode Go / Z.ai fallback entry.                            |
| **GLM 5**                | zai-coding-plan, opencode           | Claude-like behavior. Good for broad tasks.                                                 |
| **Big Pickle (GLM 4.6)** | opencode                            | Free-tier GLM. Decent fallback.                                                             |

**GPT Models** (explicit reasoning, principle-driven):

| Model             | Provider(s)                      | Notes                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT-6 Astra**   | openai, chatgpt-subscription, github-copilot, opencode | OpenAI's most capable model and the recommended GPT flagship. Default for the Plan Reviewer (xhigh, high on Copilot), `ultrabrain` (max), and `deep-high` (xhigh). `gpt-6-astra-fast` is the Fast-mode variant. Manual override option for the main agent and the `architect` category. |
| **GPT-6 Sol**     | openai, chatgpt-subscription, github-copilot, opencode | The GPT-6 workhorse tier and the default for Hephaestus (medium), with GPT-5.6 Sol kept as its fallback rung. Accepts reasoning effort `none` through `max`, no temperature, 1.05M context. `gpt-6-sol-fast` is the Fast-mode variant. |
| **GPT-6 Luna**    | openai, chatgpt-subscription             | The GPT-6 light tier. `gpt-6-luna-fast` (low) is the OpenAI rung for `explore`, `librarian` and the `quick` category. Same effort ladder and limits as GPT-6 Sol. |
| **GPT-5.6 Sol**   | openai, chatgpt-subscription, github-copilot, opencode | The `deep-low` category model (medium), on the Fast tier `gpt-5.6-sol-fast` where the OpenAI lanes serve it. Also the fallback rung under GPT-6 Sol for Hephaestus, and under GPT-6 Astra for `ultrabrain` (max). |
| **GPT-5.6 Terra** | openai, chatgpt-subscription, github-copilot | GPT-5.6 mid-tier. No longer a default for any agent; an optional balanced override.                    |
| **GPT-5.6 Luna**  | openai, chatgpt-subscription             | GPT-5.6 light tier. Not the `unspecified-low` default: that category starts at `xiaomi\|opencode-go/mimo-v2.6-pro (max)`, then `grok-4.7 (xhigh)`, then `gpt-5.6-terra (high)`. |
| **GPT-5.6 Sol override paths** | openai, chatgpt-subscription, github-copilot, opencode | The first GPT-5.6 Sol-family fallback for the Plan Consultant and `ultrabrain`. |
| **GPT 5.6 Luna Fast**  | openai, chatgpt-subscription | Fast + strong reasoning. Utility fallback after the Kimi high-speed quick default.                  |
| **GPT-5-Nano**    | openai, chatgpt-subscription, github-copilot, opencode | Ultra-cheap, fast. Good for simple utility tasks.                                                           |

**Different-behavior Models**:

| Model                      | Provider(s)                      | Notes                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini 3.1 Pro**         | google, github-copilot, opencode | Excels at visual/frontend tasks. Different reasoning style. |
| **Gemini 3.6 Flash**       | google, github-copilot, opencode | Fast, good for doc search and light tasks.                  |
| **MiniMax M3**             | opencode-go                      | Latest MiniMax flagship. Primary utility fallback, ahead of M2.7.   |
| **MiniMax M2.7**           | opencode-go                      | Fast and smart. Utility fallback for various chains.        |
| **MiniMax M2.7 Highspeed** | opencode (manual choice)         | Faster utility variant. No longer a built-in Explore or Librarian rung.|
| **Qwen 3.7 Plus**          | opencode-go                      | 1M context, high-speed reasoning. OpenCode Go utility fallback for Explore and Librarian after GPT-6 Luna Fast and DeepSeek V4.1 Flash. |

**Speed-Focused Models**:

| Model                      | Provider(s)         | Speed          | Notes                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grok Code Fast 1**       | github-copilot, xai | Very fast      | Optimized for code grep/search. Manual override option — not in the default chains. |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5**       | anthropic, github-copilot | Fast     | Good balance of speed and intelligence.                                       |
| **MiniMax M2.7 Highspeed** | opencode            | Very fast      | High-speed MiniMax variant. Manual choice only; not in any built-in chain.    |
| **GPT-5.3-codex-spark**    | openai              | Extremely fast | Blazing but compacts too aggressively. Not recommended for omo agents.        |

#### What each role does and which model it gets

**The main agent** is the session you are talking to. It runs on your session model; there is no separate agent chain for it. Claude Opus 5.5 is the recommended choice, with GPT-6 Astra or GPT-6 Sol as the recommended GPT configuration. With no `model_profile`, a fresh OmO Native session picks the first model you have connected from the Recommended list (Opus 5.5, Fable 5.1, Kimi K3, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GLM 5.3). Models with tuned prompt presets are listed in [Agent Model Matching](./agent-model-matching.md).

**Curated agents** (read-only helpers the main agent delegates to through `task(subagent_type: ...)`; chains from `packages/senpi-task/src/agents/builtin/fallback-chains.ts`):

| Agent               | Role                                       | Default Chain                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **plan-consultant** | Pre-planning gap analysis for `/ulw-plan`  | anthropic\|github-copilot\|opencode/claude-fable-5-1 (max) → anthropic\|github-copilot\|opencode/claude-opus-5-5 (max) → opencode-go\|kimi-for-coding\|moonshotai\|opencode/kimi-k3 (max) |
| **plan-reviewer**   | High-accuracy plan review gate             | openai\|chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-astra (xhigh) → github-copilot/gpt-6-astra (high) → openai\|chatgpt-subscription\|opencode/gpt-6-astra (high) → anthropic\|github-copilot\|opencode/claude-opus-5-5 (max) → … (full chain in source) |
| **explore**         | Fast codebase grep                         | kimi-coding\|kimi-for-coding/kimi-for-coding-highspeed (off) → openai\|chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-luna-fast (low) → deepseek/deepseek-flash (max) → opencode-go\|bailian-coding-plan/qwen3.7-plus → opencode-go/minimax-m2.7 → anthropic\|github-copilot/claude-haiku-4-5 |
| **librarian**       | Docs/code search                           | (same chain as `explore`)                                              |

`explore` and `librarian` trade intelligence for speed. Don't "upgrade" them to Opus; it wastes money without improving results.

**Categories** route execution work to the category worker, a fresh worker session configured by the category's model and skills. `task(category: "architect")` is the architect consult lane for architecture and debugging questions; `deep`, `ultrabrain`, `quick`, `unspecified-low`, `unspecified-high`, `visual-engineering`, `artistry`, and `writing` cover the rest. Their chains live in `packages/senpi-task/src/category/fallback-chains.ts` and are summarized in [Agent Model Matching](./agent-model-matching.md).

#### Why different models need different prompts

- **Claude models** respond well to **mechanics-driven** prompts — detailed checklists, templates, step-by-step procedures. More rules = more compliance.
- **GPT models** (especially 5.2+) respond better to **principle-driven** prompts — concise principles, XML-tagged structure, explicit decision criteria. More rules = more contradiction surface = more drift.

Key insight from Codex Plan Mode analysis: plan quality comes from making the plan **"Decision Complete"**: it must leave ZERO decisions to the implementer. The Ultrawork Planner (`/ulw-plan`) uses one thin prompt backed by the `ulw-plan` skill for that behavior instead of maintaining separate model-family prompt files, so switching your session model changes capacity, cost, and availability, not the prompt text.

#### Custom model configuration

If the user wants to override which model a curated agent or category uses, edit `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` (or a project `.omo/omo.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-consultant": { "model": "anthropic/claude-fable-5-1", "reasoning": "max" },
    "plan-reviewer": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-astra" }, // the plan gate; keep it on a strong reasoning model
  },
  "categories": {
    "deep-low": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-sol" },
  },
}
```

**Lower-risk overrides** (compatible behavior): main agent Opus 5.5 → Fable 5.1/Kimi K3/GLM 5.3 (each is on the Recommended list and has a tuned prompt preset); Plan Consultant Fable 5.1 → Opus 5.5/Kimi K3; Plan Reviewer GPT-6 Astra → Opus 5.5 (max).

**GLM 5.2 as the session model:** GLM 5.2 gets the GLM-calibrated prompt preset because its model ID is recognized as GLM. It still has less maintainer validation than Claude or Kimi.

**Dangerous overrides** (no prompt support): main agent → GPT models without a preset (presets cover the GPT-6 family and the GPT-5 line through 5.6); `explore` → Opus (massive cost waste); `librarian` → Opus (same).

#### Optional: community model-management tools

The independently maintained, experimental [oh-my-openagent VS Code extension](https://github.com/andersou/oh-my-openagent-vscode-extension) can edit user-level model assignments. It is a third-party configuration frontend, not an OMO runtime component; the OMO project does not maintain or support it, and compatibility is not guaranteed.

Use external tools only with the canonical `[opencode]` fields described in [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md). Check which file the tool changed: a nearer project `.omo/omo.jsonc` overrides user-level settings.

After using an external UI to change models:

1. Review the generated JSONC before restarting OpenCode.
2. Run `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor --verbose` to inspect its diagnostic model-resolution view. This does not replace checking nearer project config or runtime registration and model-matching rules.
3. Keep provider credentials and API keys in the provider auth flow or environment, not in shared project config.

If an external tool shows a model that OMO later skips, the source of truth is still the model-matching and registration logic in this repository. Use the [Agent Model Matching](./agent-model-matching.md) guide to check whether the selected model family is supported for that agent.

#### Provider resolution

There is no single global provider priority. The installer and runtime resolve each agent against its own fallback chain, so the winning provider depends on the agent and the subscriptions enabled.

### Step 6: First use — modes, commands, agents, skills

After install, the user interacts with oh-my-openagent through five surfaces. Walk them through each.

#### Modes (typed naturally in chat)

Just type one of these words in your message and the system injects the corresponding mode prompt:

| Keyword | Editions | What it does |
|---------|:--------:|--------------|
| `ultrawork` or `ulw` | Both | Full orchestration mode — every agent (Ultimate) or the Codex `ultrawork` component (Light) activates, doesn't stop until done |
| `team mode`, `team-mode`, `team_mode`, or `teammode` | Ultimate | Forces `team_*` tools orchestration (requires `team_mode.enabled`); bare `team` does not trigger it |
| `hyperplan` | Ultimate | Adversarial planning via 5 hostile critics |
| `hyperplan ultrawork` (combo) | Ultimate | Both at once |

#### Slash commands

All built-in slash commands are **Ultimate-only** — Codex CLI does not have a slash-command surface, so the Light edition omits this entire layer.

| Command | Editions | Purpose |
|---------|:--------:|---------|
| `/ulw-execute` | Ultimate | The main agent executes an approved ulw-plan work plan from `.omo/plans/` in the same session |
| `/goal` | Ultimate | Set, show, pause, resume, or clear a persistent thread goal that auto-continues on idle until done |
| `/stop-continuation` | Ultimate | Stop todo continuation, clear the active Goal, and clear boulder state |
| `/refactor` | Ultimate | LSP + AST-grep + TDD-verified intelligent refactor |
| `/handoff` | Ultimate | Generate detailed context summary to continue in a new session |
| `/remove-ai-slops` | Ultimate | Strip AI-generated code smells from recent changes |
| `/hyperplan` | Ultimate | Builtin command that instructs the agent to `skill(name="hyperplan")`; OpenCode does not register a builtin skill named `hyperplan` |

#### Roles — Ultimate only

The Light edition does not ship this agent roster; it ships separate Codex-native agent roles and the `teammode` component instead. The main agent delegates to the roles below; you don't usually call them directly, but knowing the cast helps:

- **The main agent**: the session you talk to. Plans, delegates, drives to completion on your session model.
- **The Ultrawork Planner** (`/ulw-plan`): interviews you and writes a decision-complete work plan before code is written.
- **`/ulw-execute`**: the main agent executes the approved work plan in the same session.
- **The category worker**: a fresh worker session configured by the category's model and skills; `task(category: "architect")` is the architect consult lane for architecture and debugging questions.
- **`explore`**: fast codebase grep.
- **`librarian`**: external docs/code search.
- **`plan-consultant`**: pre-planning consultant; analyzes the request for hidden intent and gaps before the plan is written.
- **`plan-reviewer`**: high-accuracy plan reviewer.

#### Skills

Built-in OpenCode skills load automatically when their description matches your task. The user does not need to invoke them by name. This OpenCode skill system is **Ultimate-only**; Light uses Codex-native plugin skills, including the script-driven `teammode` skill, rather than the OpenCode skill loader.

| Skill | Editions | When it triggers |
|-------|:--------:|------------------|
| `playwright` | Ultimate | Browser automation |
| `git-master` | Ultimate | Atomic commits, rebases, history search |
| `frontend` | Ultimate | UI/UX implementation work |
| `review-work` | Ultimate | Post-implementation code review |
| `$omo:remove-ai-slops` | Ultimate | Cleaning AI-generated code smells |
| `team-mode` | Ultimate | Loaded only when `team_mode.enabled` |

Add custom skills under `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project scope) or `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user scope). Each `SKILL.md` declares a description that the agent matches against your message.

#### Tutorial to tell the user

After verification, tell the user:

1. **The main agent runs on your session model, and Claude Opus 5.5 is strongly recommended** (GPT-6 Astra or GPT-6 Sol for a GPT setup). Other models may noticeably degrade the experience.
2. **Feeling lazy?** Just include `ultrawork` (or `ulw`) in your prompt. The agent figures out the rest.
3. **Need precision?** Run `/ulw-plan` to produce a plan under `.omo/plans/`, then run `/ulw-execute` so the main agent executes the verified plan in the same session.
4. **Your own agent/category setup?** Read [`docs/guide/agent-model-matching.md`](agent-model-matching.md) — the assistant can interview the user and tune the config.

Then say **Congratulations! 🎉 You have successfully set up oh-my-openagent! Type `opencode` (or `codex`) in your terminal to start using it.**

### Step 7: Light Edition deep dive (Codex CLI)

Skip this section if `--platform=opencode`. Otherwise, the user installed the **Light edition** (`omo-codex`) — here is what landed on disk and what each piece does.

#### What was installed

- **Plugin cache:** `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/<version>/`
- **Codex marketplace snapshot:** `~/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/sisyphuslabs/` (local marketplace metadata and bundled source snapshot)
- **User-linked component binaries:** `lazycodex-executor-verify`, `omo-comment-checker`, `omo-git-bash-hook`, `omo-lsp`, `omo-rules`, `omo-ulw-execute-continuation`, `omo-telemetry`, `omo-ulw-loop`, `omo-ultrawork`, `ulw`, and `ulw-loop` in `~/.local/bin` (or under `$CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR` if set). `teammode` runs through skill, hook, and script surfaces rather than a user-linked executable. The top-level `omo-agent-toolkit` command belongs to the shared oh-my-openagent launcher, not a Codex component.
- **Codex agent roles:** `~/.codex/agents/{lazycodex-clone-fidelity-reviewer,lazycodex-code-reviewer,lazycodex-gate-reviewer,lazycodex-qa-executor,lazycodex-worker-low,lazycodex-worker-medium,lazycodex-worker-high,explorer,librarian,metis,momus,plan}.toml` (there is no `lazycodex-executor` agent TOML; executor completion is handled by the `lazycodex-executor-verify` hook/bin), copied from the bundled plugin snapshot, so they keep resolving when Codex prunes old plugin-cache versions or temporary marketplace state <!-- retired-name-allowed -->
- **Codex agent roles:** `~/.codex/agents/*.toml` copied from the bundled plugin snapshot (there is no `lazycodex-executor` agent TOML; executor completion is handled by the `lazycodex-executor-verify` hook/bin), so they keep resolving when Codex prunes old plugin-cache versions or temporary marketplace state
- **Codex config edits:** `~/.codex/config.toml` gained `[features] plugins = true`, `[features] plugin_hooks = true`, `[features.multi_agent_v2] max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 16` (and, when MultiAgentV2 is not preferred, `[agents] max_threads = 1000`), `[marketplaces.sisyphuslabs]` pointing at `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs`, `[plugins."omo@sisyphuslabs"]`, plugin MCP policy blocks, SHA256-pinned `[hooks.state."omo@sisyphuslabs:..."]` entries, and optionally autonomous permission settings if accepted.

#### The components

| Component | Language | Codex hooks | What it does |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `rules` | TypeScript | `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`, `PostCompact` | Injects `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.omo/rules/**` into Codex's context |
| `comment-checker` | TypeScript | `PostToolUse` (`apply_patch`, `edit`, `write`) | Blocks AI-slop comment patterns in generated code |
| `git-bash` | TypeScript + MCP | `PreToolUse` (`Bash`), `PostCompact`, MCP server | On Windows, exposes `git_bash`; reminds Codex before the first shell-like call and again after compaction |
| `lazycodex-executor-verify` | TypeScript | `SubagentStop` | Requires evidence receipts from LazyCodex implementation workers before accepting completion |
| `lsp` | TypeScript + MCP | MCP server + post-edit hooks | Exposes LSP diagnostics, navigation, symbols, rename via MCP |
| `teammode` | TypeScript + skill | `PostToolUse` plus script-driven skill | Coordinates Codex-native agents or app threads with durable team state and thread-title guidance |
| `ultrawork` | TypeScript | `UserPromptSubmit` keyword detector | Detects `ulw`/`ultrawork` keyword; the installer links bundled Codex agent TOMLs into `$CODEX_HOME/agents` |
| `ulw-loop` | TypeScript | `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `Stop` | Multi-goal orchestration with evidence audit trail, spawn guards, and Stop-hook auto-resume via `.omo/ulw-loop/` |
| `ulw-execute-continuation` | TypeScript | `Stop`, `SubagentStop` | Continues `.omo/boulder.json` ulw-execute plans when Codex pauses at a stop boundary |
| `telemetry` | TypeScript | `SessionStart` | Emits anonymous daily active telemetry when enabled |

#### Coexistence with OpenCode

The Codex CLI Light edition and the OpenCode plugin can run side-by-side. All harnesses read the unified `omo.jsonc` surface through harness-specific `[opencode]`, `[senpi]`, and `[codex]` views, while runtime state and model selection remain harness-specific. Each emits its own daily telemetry event.

Compatibility note: LazyCodex is the Codex-platform OmO install path for `oh-my-openagent`. The bundled Codex-native subagents in `~/.codex/agents` are expected. Do not enable duplicate Codex-layer OmO/LazyCodex installs in a single `CODEX_HOME`; keep one `omo@sisyphuslabs` Codex plugin source active there. If the setup looks confused, run `npx lazycodex-ai doctor` before deleting cache or config state.

#### Codex troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `codex --help` does not list the omo plugin | Re-run `npx lazycodex-ai install` (idempotent — hook hashes are recomputed) |
| `command not found: omo-rules` or `command not found: omo-agent-toolkit` | Add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH`, or set `$CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR` to a directory already on `PATH` |
| `npm install` fails mid-install | `rm -rf ~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs` and retry |
| Plugin block is present but hooks do not fire | Verify `~/.codex/config.toml` contains `[features]\nplugins = true\nplugin_hooks = true` and `[plugins."omo@sisyphuslabs"]` |
| `Ignoring malformed agent role definition: agents.*.config_file must point to an existing file` | Re-run `npx lazycodex-ai install`. The installer repairs stale managed `[agents.*]` entries and recreates `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`. |
| `agents.max_threads cannot be set when multi_agent_v2 is enabled` in one project | Re-run `npx lazycodex-ai install` from that project. The installer repairs project-local `.codex/config.toml` layers, creates `.backup-<timestamp>` files for changed configs, and leaves user-authored `.codex` artifacts in place. |
| `SessionStart hook (failed)` / `UserPromptSubmit hook (failed)` with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `components/*/dist/cli.js` | Re-run the installer so the cached plugin is rebuilt with component `dist/` files. If the cache was manually edited, remove `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs` first. |
| `SessionStart hook (failed)` / `UserPromptSubmit hook (failed)` with only `hook exited with code 1` after install | Re-run `npx lazycodex-ai install`, then start a fresh Codex session or restart the Codex app. If the same hook fails again in the fresh session, inspect the saved hook output to identify the component command before deleting cache state. |
| Hook trust hash mismatch warnings | Re-run the installer; hashes are regenerated each install |

### Step 8: Team Mode (optional, opt-in)

Off by default. Enables a lead-and-members multi-agent system with 12 dedicated tools.

To enable, edit your plugin config:

```jsonc
// ~/.omo/omo.jsonc "[opencode]" block OR <project>/.omo/omo.jsonc "[opencode]" block
{
  "team_mode": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_parallel_members": 4,         // 1..8
    "max_members": 8,                  // 1..8 hard cap
    "tmux_visualization": false,
    "max_messages_per_run": 10000,
    "max_wall_clock_minutes": 120,
    "max_member_turns": 500,
    "message_payload_max_bytes": 32768,
    "recipient_unread_max_bytes": 262144,
    "mailbox_poll_interval_ms": 3000
  }
}
```

Restart OpenCode after the change. Twelve new tools unlock: `team_create`, `team_delete`, `team_shutdown_request`, `team_approve_shutdown`, `team_reject_shutdown`, `team_send_message`, `team_task_create`, `team_task_list`, `team_task_update`, `team_task_get`, `team_status`, `team_list`.

Team storage lives under `~/.omo/teams/{name}/` (user scope) or `<project>/.omo/teams/{name}/` (project scope — project beats user on collisions).

Member eligibility:

- **The lead is the current session.** Don't declare a lead member.
- **Members** are either `category` members (a resolvable category; `prompt` required) or `subagent_type` members naming a user-defined agent.
- **Rejected at parse**: the curated read-only agents (`explore`, `librarian`, `plan-consultant`, `plan-reviewer`) and the ulw-loop reviewer trio (`omo-native-code-reviewer`, `omo-native-qa-executor`, `omo-native-gate-reviewer`); the pre-rename `omo-senpi-code-reviewer`, `omo-senpi-qa-executor` and `omo-senpi-gate-reviewer` spellings still resolve. Delegate to them through the `task` tool instead.

Two skills already ride on top of Team Mode:

- **`security-research`** (builtin) — 3 vulnerability hunters + 2 PoC engineers audit your codebase in parallel.
- **`hyperplan`** is a keyword/command that tells the agent to load a `hyperplan` skill; that skill is not in OpenCode `createBuiltinSkills`.

Full guide: [`docs/guide/team-mode.md`](team-mode.md).

### Step 9: Advanced configuration

#### Config file precedence

```
Project layers (nearest wins): <pwd up to $HOME>/.omo/omo.json[c]
                            ↓ merged onto
User layer:                  ~/.omo/omo.json[c]
                            ↓ resolved per harness, later wins
Shared base → [opencode] block → profiles.<P> → profiles.<P>.[opencode]
                            ↓ applied once at the end
Defaults
```

Merge rules:

- Plain objects: deep merged recursively (prototype-pollution safe)
- Scalars and arrays: override replaces base value
- `mcp_env_allowlist`: **user-layer only** for security; project layers cannot extend it
- Profile activation: `OMO_PROFILE` > `OCX_PROFILE` > `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` tail `profiles/<name>` > none

Schema autocomplete in your editor:

```json
"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/assets/omo.schema.json"
```

#### Turning features off

Every agent, hook, skill, MCP, command, and tool is configurable via `disabled_*` arrays. `disabled_skills` also works at the shared base of `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` and on OmO Native (`omo`), where `{ "disabled_skills": ["frontend", "visual-qa"] }` removes those skills from the session; user and project `disabled_*` arrays are unioned rather than replaced:

```jsonc
{
  "disabled_agents": ["librarian"],
  "disabled_hooks": ["goal", "keyword-detector"],
  "disabled_skills": ["playwright"],
  "disabled_mcps": ["grep_app"],
  "disabled_commands": ["hyperplan"],
  "disabled_tools": ["interactive_bash"]
}
```

#### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `OMO_INVOCATION_NAME` | Overrides detected bin name (`oh-my-opencode`, `omo-agent-toolkit`, `lazycodex-ai`, etc.). Used by shared wrapper packages to route `lazycodex-ai` invocations to the Node installer path. |
| `OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1` | Disables all PostHog telemetry for the main plugin |
| `OMO_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0` | Same effect as above |
| `OMO_CODEX_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1` | Disables PostHog telemetry for the Codex CLI Light edition only |
| `OMO_CODEX_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0` | Same effect as above |
| `OMO_DISABLE_PROCESS_CLEANUP=1` | Disables background-agent best-effort process cleanup on parent exit |
| `OMO_OPENCLAW_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` | Timeout for OpenClaw outbound shell/HTTP commands |
| `OMO_OPENCLAW_DEBUG=1` | Enables OpenClaw debug logging |
| `OMO_OPENCLAW_REPLY_LISTENER_STARTUP_TOKEN` | Startup token for OpenClaw reply listener daemon |
| `OMO_OPENCLAW_REPLY_LISTENER_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` | Timeout for reply listener startup |
| `OH_MY_OPENCODE_FORCE_BASELINE=1` | Forces baseline (non-AVX2) binary selection on x64 |
| `OPENCODE_DEFAULT_AGENT` | Default agent for `omo-agent-toolkit run` (overridden by `--agent`) |
| `CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR` | Overrides `~/.local/bin` for Codex component symlinks |

#### Hash-anchored edits (Hashline)

Hash-anchored edits are off by default (`hashline_edit` is a boolean, default false). Set `"hashline_edit": true` to tag Read output with `LINE#ID` hashes and replace the edit tool. The `hashline_edit` tool rejects edits when the file has changed since the last read.

#### OpenClaw (optional outbound notifications)

OpenClaw is a bidirectional external integration: outbound dispatchers fire on session events (idle, error, completion) to Discord/Telegram/HTTP/shell sinks; an optional inbound reply listener daemon polls Discord/Telegram and `send-keys` replies back into the tracked tmux pane. Configure under the `openclaw` config block. See `packages/omo-opencode/src/openclaw/` for the full reference.

### Step 10: Maintenance

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor` | Run 8 OpenCode checks (System / Configuration / TUI Plugin / Deprecated Reasoning Keys / Tools / Models / Telemetry / Team Mode), or the separate Codex target checks (Codex / codex-components / codex-runtime-wrapper) |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent boulder` | Inspect boulder work-state and per-task stats from `.omo/boulder.json` |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent refresh-model-capabilities` | Refresh `models.json` cache from models.dev |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent mcp oauth login <server-name>` | Authenticate with an MCP server using OAuth |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent mcp oauth logout <server-name>` | Remove stored OAuth tokens for an MCP server |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent mcp oauth status [server-name]` | Show OAuth token status for one or all servers |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent get-local-version` | Show installed version vs npm latest |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent version` | Print the CLI version |
| `bunx oh-my-openagent run <message>` | Non-interactive session; waits until todos clear and background tasks idle |

Postinstall validates both platform binary resolution and OpenCode version compatibility — the validation runs after every npm install.

## Telemetry & Privacy

Anonymous telemetry is enabled by default to track active installations (DAU/WAU/MAU). For both products:

- A single event is sent **at most once per UTC day per machine**
- Uses a SHA256-hashed installation identifier — never the raw hostname
- PostHog person profiles are **not** created
- The raw hostname is never transmitted

Per product:

| Product | Event name | Sources |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Main plugin | `omo_daily_active` | Plugin load (`plugin_loaded`) + `run` CLI (`run_started`) |
| Codex CLI Light edition | `omo_codex_daily_active` | Installer (`install_completed`) + Codex `SessionStart` hook (`session_start`) |

Opt-out:

```bash
# Disable the main plugin's telemetry
export OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1
# or
export OMO_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0

# Disable only the Codex CLI Light edition telemetry
export OMO_CODEX_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1
# or
export OMO_CODEX_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0
```

The global flags (`OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG`, `OMO_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY`) also suppress the Codex CLI Light edition telemetry.

The main plugin can also opt out through config:

```jsonc
{
  "telemetry": false
}
```

See [Privacy Policy](../legal/privacy-policy.md) and [Terms of Service](../legal/terms-of-service.md).

## Uninstall

### Remove the OpenCode plugin

```bash
# 1. Remove the plugin entry from opencode.json
jq '.plugin = [.plugin[] | select(. != "oh-my-openagent" and . != "oh-my-opencode")]' \
    ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json > /tmp/oc.json && \
    mv /tmp/oc.json ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json

# 2. Remove the unified config and any leftover legacy plugin config files (optional)
rm -f ~/.omo/omo.jsonc ~/.omo/omo.json \
      ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.json \
      ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.jsonc ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.json

# 3. Remove project config (if you have one)
rm -f .omo/omo.jsonc .omo/omo.json \
      .opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc .opencode/oh-my-openagent.json \
      .opencode/oh-my-opencode.jsonc .opencode/oh-my-opencode.json

# 4. Verify removal
opencode --version
# Plugin should no longer be loaded
```

### Remove the Codex CLI Light edition

```bash
npx lazycodex-ai uninstall
# backward-compatible alias:
npx lazycodex-ai cleanup

omo-agent-toolkit uninstall --platform=codex
# backward-compatible alias:
omo-agent-toolkit cleanup --platform=codex
```

The uninstall command removes the managed `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs` and `~/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/sisyphuslabs` trees, strips `sisyphuslabs` / legacy LazyCodex marketplace, plugin, hook-state, and managed agent blocks from `~/.codex/config.toml` after writing a timestamped backup, and removes managed agent TOML files from `~/.codex/agents/`, including orphaned files whose install manifest is already gone.

If a workspace still has old project-local Codex state, run `npx lazycodex-ai uninstall --project <path>` or run it from that workspace. The command repairs only the known project-local Codex config conflict and reports legacy `.codex` artifact paths; it does not delete project-owned files automatically.

## Operational notes

- Claude Code compatibility is supported (hooks, commands, skills, MCPs, plugins).
- Claude Code plugin discovery load timeout is 10 seconds.
- Runtime logger: `oh-my-opencode.log` in the OS temp dir (`/tmp` on Linux, `/var/folders/.../T/` on macOS, `%TEMP%` on Windows), 50 MB cap with `.1`/`.2` backup segments.
- Dual-publish during the rename transition: `oh-my-opencode` and `oh-my-openagent` are both published. Inside `opencode.json`, the compatibility layer prefers the entry `"oh-my-openagent"`, while legacy `"oh-my-opencode"` entries still load with a warning. Plugin configuration lives in the unified `omo.jsonc`; legacy `oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]` files are imported once by the migration engine and no longer read at runtime. If `doctor` warns about the legacy package name, update your `opencode.json` plugin entry.
