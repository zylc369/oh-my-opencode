# packages/omo-codex/ - Codex CLI Light Edition (lazycodex)

**Generated:** 2026-08-24 / f3642fcda (refresh pass)

## STOP. THIS IS THE CODEX EDITION. QA IS MANDATORY. EVERY SINGLE TIME. INSTALL THE LOCAL BUILD INTO AN ISOLATED `CODEX_HOME`.

> **IF YOU CHANGE ANY CODEX-CONNECTED COMPONENT (the vendored `plugin/`, a component under `plugin/components/`, the installer in `scripts/` or `src/install/`, config migration, telemetry, or hook wiring), YOU MUST QA IT AGAINST A REAL, LOCALLY-INSTALLED, ISOLATED CODEX. ALWAYS. EVERY SINGLE TIME. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

**"It typechecks" is NOT QA. "`bun test` is green" is NOT QA.** YOU MUST INSTALL THE LOCAL BUILD AND DRIVE REAL CODEX, then RECORD THE EVIDENCE TO DISK. NO EVIDENCE == NO QA == NO COMMIT == NO PUSH.

### ISOLATE THE INSTALL. USE THE LOCAL BUILD. NEVER THE PUBLISHED PACKAGE. NEVER YOUR REAL `~/.codex`.

1. **POINT `CODEX_HOME` AT A THROWAWAY DIR AND INSTALL THIS REPO'S LOCAL BUILD INTO IT.** LOCAL build. ISOLATED home. Every time.
   ```bash
   export CODEX_HOME="$(mktemp -d)/codex"
   node packages/omo-codex/scripts/install-local.mjs install   # installs the LOCAL repo build into the isolated CODEX_HOME
   ```
   The installer reads `CODEX_HOME` (and `OMO_CODEX_PROJECT` for project scope), so an isolated home keeps the real `~/.codex/{config.toml,plugins,agents}` UNTOUCHED.
2. **RUN THE CODEX GATE:** `bun run test:codex` (installer + config migration + plugin component suite; the canonical Codex compatibility gate, ubuntu/macos/windows in CI).
3. **DRIVE CODEX UNDER tmux** in that isolated `CODEX_HOME`: confirm the plugin loads, `omo@sisyphuslabs` is enabled in the sandbox `config.toml`, and the hooks actually fire (`SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PostCompact` / `Stop` / `SubagentStop`). **CONFIRM YOUR REAL `~/.codex/config.toml` WAS NOT TOUCHED.**

**RECORD THE EVIDENCE UNDER `.omo/evidence/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-slug>/`** (one organized subfolder per change; the directory is gitignored, so the files stay local and the PR body carries the summary): WHY THERE IS NO REGRESSION (the isolated-install transcript, before/after of the real `~/.codex` proving it is untouched, exact commands and output) and PROOF THAT EVERY INTENDED CHANGE LANDED (the new behavior observed inside the isolated Codex). See the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) "STOP. QA IS MANDATORY" section for the full cross-harness mandate.

**ALWAYS. EVERY TIME. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### Dev dogfood (real `~/.codex`, distinct from the isolated QA flow above)

`bun run install:codex-dev` swaps your real install for this repo's local build stamped as version `dev` (env `LAZYCODEX_DEV_VERSION`, default `dev`). Everywhere the plugin version shows (cache dir `.../omo/dev/`, `plugin.json`, and the per-turn `(OmO dev)` hook prefix) reads `dev`, so you can SEE which build is loaded. This is dogfooding on your REAL home; it is NOT a substitute for the mandatory isolated-`CODEX_HOME` QA above. Impl: `resolveLazyCodexPluginVersion` `versionOverride` (`src/install/lazycodex-version-stamp.ts`) fed from `env.LAZYCODEX_DEV_VERSION` in `runCodexInstaller`; display in `get-local-version` (`dev` status on a non-semver stamp).


## OVERVIEW

`@oh-my-opencode/omo-codex` (private, v5.0.0-beta.18): the Codex harness adapter = the **Light Edition** (omo for the OpenAI Codex CLI). Vendors a Codex plugin namespace `omo` + a TypeScript installer + telemetry. Public distribution = the live `lazycodex-ai` npm package/bin alias. `lazycodex` remains a root bin alias and the [`code-yeongyu/lazycodex`](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lazycodex) repository identity, but is not an npm package. Codex marketplace identity = `sisyphuslabs` / plugin `omo` (`omo@sisyphuslabs`). Full identity + the publish/deploy pipeline live in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) "CODEX LIGHT EDITION" section.

## LAYOUT

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `package.json` | `@oh-my-opencode/omo-codex` (private). Deps: `@oh-my-opencode/utils`. Scripts: `typecheck`, `test`, `build:plugin`, `sync:skills`. |
| `marketplace.json` | Codex marketplace manifest. Declares marketplace `sisyphuslabs`, single installable plugin `omo`. |
| `MARKETPLACE.md` | Native Codex marketplace notes for `sisyphuslabs` / `omo`. |
| `index.d.ts` | Type barrel re-exporting `src/`. |
| `plugin/` | Vendored Codex plugin namespace `omo`; pkg `@sisyphuslabs/omo-codex-plugin` (dep `@oh-my-opencode/shared-skills`). Holds `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (brandColor `#7C3AED`), the `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` `hooks` array wiring 23 individual hook JSON files in `hooks/` (each component's own `hooks/hooks.json` is assembled into those files by the build), `components/` (11 workspaces + bootstrap + test-support + lcx), generated aggregate `skills/` (gitignored, built by sync-skills), `.mcp.json`. |
| `scripts/` | Generated/bundled Node ESM install entrypoints and parity tests. Published paths such as `scripts/install-local.mjs` stay stable while source lives in `src/install/`. |
| `src/` | TypeScript runtime consumed by the CLI: `install/` (Codex cache install, config mutation, agent links, local marketplace snapshot, cleanup, routing) + `telemetry/`. |
| `tsconfig.json` | Bun-targeted strict config; included in root `typecheck:packages`. |

## COMPONENTS (10 live workspaces + 3 special dirs)

Per `plugin/package.json` `workspaces[]`: `comment-checker`, `git-bash`, `lazycodex-executor-verify`, `lsp`, `rules`, `ulw-execute-continuation`, `teammode`, `telemetry`, `ultrawork`, `ulw-loop`. Special cases: `bootstrap` (runtime provisioner with its own package.json, deliberately OUTSIDE the workspaces array, built standalone by `plugin/scripts/build-components.mjs`), `test-support` (test helper dir, no package.json, not a component), and `lcx` (skills-only carrier under `plugin/components/lcx/`, no package.json and not a workspace; holds the `lcx-report-bug` / `lcx-contribute-bug-fix` / `lcx-doctor` skills that `sync-skills` copies from `components/lcx/skills/`). `workflow-selector` was removed 2026-06-29 (only an untracked `dist/` residue may linger locally). Each component is an isolated workspace under `plugin/components/<name>/` with its own `AGENTS.md` + `hooks/hooks.json` when it owns hook behavior. Wired to Codex lifecycle events `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PostCompact` / `Stop` / `SubagentStop`. Older components originate from `code-yeongyu/codex-{rules,comment-checker,lsp,ultrawork,ulw-loop,ulw-execute-continuation}`; `teammode`, `bootstrap`, `lazycodex-executor-verify` are repo-native.

**sync-skills pipeline** (`plugin/scripts/sync-skills.mjs`, run by the plugin build): wipes `plugin/skills/` → copies 10 COMPONENT skills first (`comment-checker`, `lcx-report-bug`, `lcx-contribute-bug-fix`, `lcx-doctor`, `lsp`, `rules`, `teammode`, `ulw-loop`, `ulw-plan`, `ultrawork` from `plugin/components/*/skills/*`; same-named shared skills are skipped) → copies remaining shared skills → `adaptSkillForCodex()` inserts Codex Harness Tool Compatibility guidance, applies overlays (`ulw-execute` / `review-work`), and writes `agents/openai.yaml` display metadata with the `(OmO) ` prefix.

**Ultrawork skill pointer:** the ultrawork `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects a compact `<ultrawork-mode>` pointer (<4096 bytes; Codex App truncates large hook output) directing the model to read the full directive from the bundled `ultrawork` skill; full-directive fallback when the skills tree is absent. Mirror copy in `ulw-loop/src/ultrawork-skill-pointer.ts`; byte-identity pinned by `plugin/test/ultrawork-skill-pointer.test.mjs`.

## INSTALL (mechanics)

Source entry: `src/install/install-codex.ts` plus `src/install/install-local-cli.ts`; generated Node entrypoints live at `packages/omo-codex/scripts/install*.mjs` for stable published paths. Targets: plugin cache `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/<version>/`; local marketplace snapshot under `~/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/sisyphuslabs/plugins/omo/`; durable agent TOML copies under `~/.codex/agents/`; enables `omo@sisyphuslabs` in `~/.codex/config.toml`; component CLIs into the resolved bin dir: explicit `CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR` / `binDir` option, else `<codexHome>/bin` when `CODEX_HOME` is non-default, else `~/.local/bin` (`codex-installer-bin-dir.ts`). The installer records that directory in `.installed-bin-dir.json` beside the plugin cache (`codex-installed-bin-dir.ts`), because `CODEX_LOCAL_BIN_DIR` is typically a one-shot override a later uninstall cannot recompute; `codex-cleanup.ts` reads the manifest BEFORE removing managed state, since the manifest lives inside the trees being deleted. Windows: Git Bash preflight discovers `OMO_CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH`, standard Git for Windows locations, then PATH; if missing, it prints manual install guidance and stops without running `winget`. Non-Windows keeps the `git_bash` MCP manifest bundled but writes `enabled = false`.

## UNIFIED CONFIG (omo.jsonc)

The Codex config loader (`plugin/shared/src/config-loader.ts`, `getCodexOmoConfig()`) reads the unified config surface through `@oh-my-opencode/omo-config-core` (imported by relative source path, keeping the plugin bundle dependency-clean): user layer `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` plus walked project `.omo/omo.json[c]` layers, resolved as the `[codex]` view (shared base -> `[codex]` -> `profiles.<P>` -> `profiles.<P>.[codex]`). Unsupported keys and all loader/migration diagnostics surface as `warnings` on the result. Before reading, the loader runs `runCodexStartupMigration()`, which invokes ONLY the `2026-07-codex-config-jsonc` migration group: `~/.omo/config.jsonc` (plus its sidecar) imports into `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` via the shared lock+journal engine, no-clobber with skipped-value diagnostics, sources moving to `~/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC-ts>-opencode-config/.omo/`. The `oh-my-*` group is owned by the opencode/senpi side; whichever harness runs first applies each group exactly once via `_migrations` markers. Full semantics: [`docs/reference/omo-json.md`](../../docs/reference/omo-json.md).

## CONFIG MIGRATION (SessionStart)

The plugin `SessionStart` hook (matcher `^startup$`) runs `plugin/scripts/auto-update.mjs` → `migrateCodexConfig()` over `~/.codex/config.toml` + any project `.codex/config.toml`, before the update throttle. Healthy marketplace-managed installs still skip npx self-update and point users at `codex plugin marketplace upgrade sisyphuslabs`; stale local marketplace cache/bin state is the exception, and starts the npx installer as a local repair when the cached marketplace manifest or managed component bins point at missing OMO payloads. Beyond syncing the managed reasoning profile from `plugin/model-catalog.json`, it runs a **model-aware** MultiAgentV2 guard via `forceDisableMultiAgentV2()` (`plugin/scripts/migrate-codex-config/multi-agent-v2-guard.mjs`):

- If the selected root `model` (or SessionStart hook `model`, which wins when present) resolves to `multi_agent_version: "v2"` in `CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json` (GPT-6 Astra and GPT-5.6 terra/sol families), or the catalog is unavailable but the effective session model is `gpt-6*` or `gpt-5.6*` (`prefersMultiAgentV2()`), the guard **clears** managed `enabled = false` / `#26753` comments **and** any `hide_spawn_agent_metadata = false` (written by OMO installers <= 4.15.x; it re-adds agent_type/model properties to spawn_agent and mismatches the reserved schema, 400 on codex-cli 0.144.1), leaving V2 unset so Codex can follow the reserved `collaboration.spawn_agent` schema (lazycodex#118 / oh-my-openagent#6002). On that same V2-preferred signal `ensureSubagentConcurrencyLimit()` also removes `agents.max_threads` (invalid while V2 is active). Thread caps are never inserted or raised: `max_concurrent_threads_per_session` is left alone unless it carries a value LazyCodex itself used to write (`1000` or `16`), in which case the key is removed so Codex stock defaults apply; any other user value is preserved.
- On the SessionStart hook CLI path, if the active session model cannot be read from stdin, the guard **skips** force-disable instead of assuming the config.toml default (so `codex -m gpt-5.6-terra` cannot be broken by a stale default model line).
- Otherwise it keeps the openai/codex#26753 force-disable path: write `[features.multi_agent_v2] enabled = false` and flip `enabled = true`.
- On **every** path (including the skip paths above) the guard first removes the `[features]` boolean shorthand `multi_agent_v2 = true|false`: a boolean key plus the same-name table that `ensureSubagentConcurrencyLimit()` appends would be invalid TOML.

The installer (`src/install/codex-multi-agent-v2-config.ts`) mirrors the migration's model awareness via `resolveCodexMultiAgentVersion()` (root `model` against `models_cache.json` next to config.toml; `gpt-6*` and `gpt-5.6*` count as V2 when the catalog is missing): it never enables V2 and never writes a thread cap. Neither `agents.max_threads` nor `features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session` is inserted; an existing key holding a value LazyCodex previously wrote (`1000` for `agents.max_threads`; `1000` or `16` for `max_concurrent_threads_per_session`) is removed so Codex stock defaults apply, and any other user-set value is left untouched, never raised. On V1/unknown models it converts a `multi_agent_v2 = false` shorthand into table-form `enabled = false`; on V2-preferred models it removes `agents.max_threads` and does NOT materialize the disable (a config-level disable 400s the reserved collaboration.spawn_agent schema, #6008). The migration's `ensureSubagentConcurrencyLimit()` mirrors the same no-insert / remove-own-value / preserve-user-value rules.

## DEFAULT MODEL CATALOG

Three mirrored sources define the managed model defaults and must agree: `plugin/model-catalog.json`, `plugin/scripts/migrate-codex-config/catalog.mjs` (`FALLBACK_CATALOG`), and `src/install/codex-model-catalog.ts`. The current catalog version is `2026-09-08.gpt-6-astra-600k-high`: root `model = "gpt-6-astra"`, `model_context_window = 600000`, `model_reasoning_effort = "high"`, `plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"`; the `worker` and `verifier` roles are `gpt-6-astra` at `high`. Managed legacy profiles (the three gpt-5.5 entries plus `legacy.gpt-5.6-sol-650k-high`, matching `gpt-5.6-sol` / 650000 / high / xhigh) are upgraded in place to the current values; a root model matching neither the current catalog nor a managed profile is preserved as the user's choice. All 12 bundled agent TOMLs under `plugin/components/ultrawork/agents/` run on `gpt-6-astra` with their per-role `model_reasoning_effort`; `src/install/managed-agent-reasoning-defaults.ts` carries the per-agent upgrade chain from the older gpt-5.6 models, and a user-customized effort survives the model move. The Hephaestus bundled rule ships a `gpt-6.md` variant (selected by `packages/rules-engine/src/engine/finder.ts` for any model slug containing `gpt-6`) alongside `gpt-5.5.md` / `gpt-5.6.md`, and the rules `post-compact-budget.ts` table registers `gpt-6-astra` / `gpt-6-astra-fast` at 600k. Entry guards for all plugin CLI scripts go through `scripts/entry-guard.mjs` `isCliEntry()`, the plain `pathToFileURL(process.argv[1])` comparison silently no-ops the whole hook when the plugin cache is reached through a symlink. Opt-out: `LAZYCODEX_CONFIG_MIGRATION_DISABLED=1` / `OMO_CODEX_CONFIG_MIGRATION_DISABLED=1`. The hook also emits restart notifications: when an update starts it persists `pendingNotice` ({fromVersion, toVersion, startedAt}) in the auto-update state, and once a later startup runs at >= toVersion it emits an update-completed notice (checked before the throttle, so throttled startups still notify). Non-empty notices are printed as a single stdout JSON line (`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, SessionStart) and audited as `notified` events in the update log; pinned by `plugin/test/auto-update-restart-notice.test.mjs`. Pinned by `plugin/test/migrate-codex-config.test.mjs` (part of `bun run test:codex`).

## TELEMETRY

Event `omo_codex_daily_active`, at most once per UTC day per machine. Two sources: install (`install_completed`) + plugin `SessionStart` (`session_start`). Id `sha256("omo-codex:" + hostname)`; dedup state `~/.local/share/omo-codex/posthog-activity.json`; PostHog person profiles disabled. Opt-out: `OMO_CODEX_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1` / `OMO_CODEX_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0` (global `OMO_*` flags also disable). Parity with the main plugin pinned by `src/telemetry/cross-package-equivalence.test.ts`.

## DEPLOY (sync script)

`script/sync-lazycodex-marketplace.ts <source-root> <lazycodex-root>` copies `marketplace.json` to `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and `plugin/` to `plugins/omo/`, bundles LSP/Git Bash MCP runtime dists into `plugins/omo/components/*/dist/`, bundles root CLI runtimes into `plugins/omo/dist/cli` and `plugins/omo/dist/cli-node`, rewrites `.mcp.json` paths, then validates via `script/lazycodex-marketplace-validation.ts`. Mechanism = file copy + commit push, NOT a git subtree. The triggering `publish.yml` behavior (`publish_lazycodex` input + automatic stable-release Codex marketplace sync gated on empty `dist_tag`) is documented in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## NOTES

- `@sisyphuslabs/omo-codex-plugin` (the shipped Codex plugin bundle) is distinct from `@oh-my-opencode/omo-codex` (this adapter package).
- Codex marketplace name is `sisyphuslabs`, never `lazycodex`.
- `@oh-my-opencode/omo-codex` is private (not published to npm on its own); its assets ship via the root `package.json` `files` array.
- `bunfig.toml` excludes `packages/omo-codex/plugin/**` from the root `bun test`; the plugin carries its own `node --test` suite. Full Codex suite: `bun run test:codex`.
- Per-component detail lives in `plugin/components/*/AGENTS.md`; do not duplicate it here.
