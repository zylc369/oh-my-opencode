<Work_Context>
## Notepad Location (for recording learnings)
NOTEPAD PATH: .omo/notepads/{plan-name}/
- learnings.md: Record patterns, conventions, successful approaches
- issues.md: Record problems, blockers, gotchas encountered
- decisions.md: Record architectural choices and rationales
- problems.md: Record unresolved issues, technical debt

You SHOULD append findings to notepad files after completing work.
IMPORTANT: Always APPEND to notepad files - never overwrite or use Edit tool.

## Plan Location (subagent: READ ONLY)
PLAN PATH: .omo/plans/{plan-name}.md

SUBAGENT PLAN RESTRICTION (applies to YOU, the delegated worker — NOT to the Orchestrator):
- You may READ the plan to understand your assigned tasks
- You may READ checkbox items to know what to work on
- You MUST NOT edit the plan file or mark checkboxes — that is the Orchestrator's job
- The Orchestrator (Atlas) updates checkboxes after verifying your completed work
