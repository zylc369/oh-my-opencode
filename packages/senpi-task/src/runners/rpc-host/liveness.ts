 * The two questions the lifecycle asks a daemon once per pass: "are you there?" (`get_protocol_info`
 * through the engine's own `probeHost`) and "which session paths do you still hold?"
 * (`list_sessions { include_workers: true }` - worker rows are hidden by default, and every task
 * child is a worker). Both answer conservatively on failure: an unreachable daemon holds nothing,
 * which makes the lifecycle reopen from JSONL rather than attach, and close nothing.
