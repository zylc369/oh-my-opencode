// authoritative: every collected nudge is re-validated against the candidate set, the session
// ledger, the hint shape and the configured cap (defence in depth - the closure already
// enforced the same rules at call time).
//
// Accepted nudges wait in a per-session pending file until the next turn injects
// them. The payload is self-describing ({ version, sessionId, writtenAt, nudges })
// so a filename collision from session-id sanitization can never hand one session
// another session's nudges, and so a payload nobody consumed expires instead of
// surfacing days later. A compaction retracts the session's payload through
// `delete` at the moment it is accepted; nothing is stamped on the payload for it.
