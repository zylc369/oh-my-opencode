 * The kibitzer judge's ONLY output channel, as an in-process closure over the launch input: the
 * same contract the old `-e` nudge extension enforced in the spawned child, but validated against
 * the live launch state synchronously at call time so a rejected call returns an error result the
 * judge can read and correct. Hint rules come from memory-core's `describeInvalidHint`; candidate
 * and surfaced membership mirror `validateNudges`, which the parent still runs over the collected
 * set before persisting (defence in depth - duplicates, should the judge repeat a path, are
 * dropped there, not here).
 *
 * Once `accepted` reaches `maxItems` nothing more can be recorded this run, so the result carries
 * `terminate: true` and the agent loop ends the turn on the tool batch. Without it the judge has to
 * produce one more assistant message with nothing to say, and senpi's empty-assistant recovery
 * settles a second silent stop as an error (issue #7963).
