# Teammode

Run a named team of cooperating Codex workers under one leader, with durable state on disk.
This is a Codex-only workflow. It never depends on an external terminal runner - it
coordinates through Codex's own collaboration tools plus a bundled state script, on ONE of
two transports chosen up front: native MultiAgentV2 agents, or Codex App threads as the
fallback.

## When to use a team (and when to use plain subagents instead)

Use a TEAM when EITHER holds:
- the work does NOT split into perfectly isolated pieces, but doing it in parallel is clearly
  more convenient - members will need to see and react to each other's findings; or
- one task still needs exploration, yet its GOAL is already clear - parallel investigation under
  a fixed objective.

Use plain fire-and-forget subagents (`$ulw` / one-off `spawn_agent` workers) - NOT a team - when
EITHER holds:
- the work IS perfectly isolated, so there is no coordination cost worth paying; or
- the GOAL is still ambiguous, where one mind should resolve direction before any fan-out.

A team buys cross-member coordination at a real overhead cost; only spend it when coordination
is the thing you actually need.

## Pick the transport FIRST - then tell the user

Before creating any team state, decide which transport this session can run.
Inspect your active tool list and select:

1. **MultiAgentV2 (preferred)** - select when the flat V2 collaboration tools are ALL active:
   flat `spawn_agent` whose schema requires `task_name`, plus `send_message`, `followup_task`,
   `wait_agent`, `list_agents`, and `interrupt_agent`. Members are durable native agents
   addressed by task name / agent path (`/root/<task_name>`). The namespaced
   `multi_agent_v1.*` surface never qualifies as a team transport.
2. **Codex App threads (fallback)** - select when flat V2 is not available but the
   `codex_app.*` thread tools are (`create_thread`, `read_thread`, `send_message_to_thread`,
   `set_thread_title`, `set_thread_archived`).
3. **Neither set visible** - if a `tool_search` tool is active, search for the missing sets
   (e.g. `spawn_agent`, `codex_app`) before concluding: some environments defer tools behind
   tool search. A hit is only a lead: revalidate that the visible result is the COMPLETE,
   mutually compatible transport set from case 1 or 2 before selecting it. Do not combine
   partial hits from different transports.
4. **Neither set exists** - teammode cannot run here. Do NOT run `init` or fake a team with
   partial tooling. If another visible plain-subagent mechanism can independently spawn,
   communicate with, and observe plain workers, announce that exact mechanism and use it for
   non-overlapping scopes. Otherwise continue serially and report the capability limitation;
   never promise or imply plain subagents that this session cannot create.

Then, BEFORE running `init` (or instead of it in case 4), tell the user in one line what this
environment provides and which route you picked:
- `Teammode transport: MultiAgentV2 (flat spawn_agent with task_name).`
- `Teammode transport: Codex App threads (flat V2 tools not present in this session).`
- `Teammode unavailable: neither MultiAgentV2 nor codex_app tools exist in this session -
  using <visible plain-subagent mechanism> for independent scopes.`
- `Teammode unavailable: neither MultiAgentV2 nor codex_app tools exist in this session, and
  no compatible plain-subagent mechanism is available - continuing serially.`

Pass the choice to `init` as `--transport multi_agent_v2` or `--transport codex_app`. The
transport is recorded in `team.json` and is IMMUTABLE for the team's lifetime: a V2 spawn
failure is a V2 blocker to report, never permission to mix Codex App threads into the same
team. Never probe by trial-calling tools; read your tool list, and search it with
`tool_search` only when a needed set is not visible.

## You are the leader - orchestrate, do not implement

The main session is ALWAYS the team leader; you orchestrate directly and never spin up a separate
leader worker. Your job is orchestration, NOT writing product code: split the work and assign each
slice, hold live situational awareness of every member, verify and QA what they deliver, relay
findings between members, instruct and unblock, and synthesize the result. DELEGATE every code edit
to a member - if you catch yourself editing product files while the team runs, that work was a
member's slice you should have handed off. You own direction, verification, and integration (the
merge), not the keystrokes.

## Compose by part, ownership, or perspective - not by job title

A team is ALWAYS two or more members - never a single-member team. One worker on an isolated
job is a plain subagent, not a team; if you end up with a single member,
either split off a second distinct slice or drop the team and use a subagent.

Compose the team from what you actually KNOW about the work. Ground the split in real knowledge
of the problem, then divide it into clear, non-overlapping responsibilities - one per aspect of
the work - and give each member exactly one. No two members may own the same thing. Define each
member by a concrete slice: a specific part of the codebase, an ownership area, or a distinct
perspective/lens. Assigning a vague role ("backend dev", "release analyst", "the tester") is an
anti-pattern - it gives the member no real boundary and invites overlap. Each member's `focus`
names what they own concretely; the `lens` is one of `area`, `ownership`, or `perspective`.
Give each member a short, distinct `--name` too - its role or what it watches (e.g.
`app-server-lifecycle`, `mailbox-delivery`) - it labels the member everywhere; never reuse
one name for two members. On MultiAgentV2 teams also give each member a unique
`--task-name` in `lowercase_digits_underscores` form - it becomes the member's permanent
agent path `/root/<task_name>`.

## Run the script - never hand-write team state

A bundled, dependency-free Node script owns all team state so you never author `team.json` or
the member manual by hand. Run it with `node` (or `bun`); it works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
Replace `<skill-root>` with this skill's own directory.

```
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" init        --name "<team>" --session-name "<session>" --transport multi_agent_v2|codex_app [--session <leader_thread_id>] [--worktree] [--base-branch dev]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" add-member  --team <session_id> --id A --name "<short role>" [--task-name <v2_task_name>] --focus "<part/ownership/perspective>" --lens area|ownership|perspective --deliverable "<...>" [--branch <branch>]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" bind-agent   --team <session_id> --id A --agent-path /root/<task_name> [--cwd <path>]   # multi_agent_v2 teams
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" bind-thread  --team <session_id> --id A --thread <thread_id> [--cwd <path>]             # codex_app teams
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" member-prompt --team <session_id> --id A
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" set-status   --team <session_id> --id A --status reported|blocked|active|archived [--note "<...>"]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" worktree-add    --team <session_id> --id A [--base-branch <branch>]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" worktree-remove --team <session_id> --id A [--force]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" integrate       --team <session_id> [--id A]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" archive      --team <session_id> [--id A] [--note "<...>"]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" delete       --team <session_id> [--force]
node "<skill-root>/scripts/team.mjs" status       --team <session_id>
```

`init` creates `.omo/teams/{session_id}/` containing `team.json` (the single durable state file:
team id, transport, the main-session leader, the member roster, status, worktree config, and a
lifecycle log), `guide.md` (the auto-generated member field manual), and `artifacts/` (a shared
exchange space). On codex_app teams `{session_id}` is the leader's Codex session id when you can
pass it via `--session`; otherwise the script generates a stable handle. Re-running `init` is a
safe no-op. Every mutating subcommand rewrites `guide.md`, so the manual always matches the
current team.

Mutating subcommands take a per-team state lock before reading and rewriting `team.json`. It is
safe to run independent `add-member`, `bind-agent`, `bind-thread`, `set-status`, `archive`,
`delete`, `guide`, and worktree mutation commands concurrently against the same team: they
serialize and each command reads the latest committed state before writing. If a command reports
that team state is locked, do not treat the intended mutation as complete; retry after the named
command finishes, or inspect `.omo/teams/{session_id}/.team.lock/owner.json` if the previous
command crashed. `bind-agent` refuses codex_app teams and `bind-thread` refuses multi_agent_v2
teams, and a refused command never changes `team.json`.

## Create the team and its members

`init` the team, then `add-member` once per member. What happens next depends on the transport.

**MultiAgentV2 teams:**
1. If a member needs an isolated worktree, run `worktree-add` BEFORE spawning it - flat
   `spawn_agent` has no cwd argument, so the path must ride in the bootstrap message.
2. Spawn each member with flat `spawn_agent` using only the V2 schema fields:
   `task_name` is that member's `--task-name`, `message` is the bootstrap printed by
   `add-member` / `member-prompt`, and `fork_turns` is `"none"` (members read
   `guide.md` for context; full parent history is not their context model). Put any
   role, priority, or task-specific routing instruction in `message`; V2 does not accept
   `agent_type`, `model`, `reasoning_effort`, or `service_tier`, so members inherit the
   session model.
3. `bind-agent --agent-path` with the canonical task name the spawn returned (normally
   `/root/<task_name>`); binding confirms the runtime identity matches the roster and records
   the member's cwd. Members are durable: they persist as subagent threads, survive idling,
   and are re-tasked with `followup_task` - never respawned under a second name.
4. Members appear in `list_agents` with their task paths; inspect status there instead of
   deep links (V2 exposes no thread title or `codex://` link surface to you).

**Codex App teams:**
1. Create a durable thread per member with `codex_app.create_thread` - ALWAYS this tool for
   every member - titled `[team name] <member name>`, using THAT member's own name, so no two
   threads share a title. `add-member` prints the exact title to use. If the tool accepts a
   working directory / cwd argument, set it to that member's worktree; otherwise the member's
   manual tells it to `cd` there first. Use `codex_app.set_thread_title` if the title did not
   land at creation. If Codex returns only `pendingWorktreeId`, the worktree-backed thread is
   not ready yet: do not `bind-thread` and do not send the member bootstrap. Wait until Codex
   surfaces a real `threadId`, then set the title, bind that real id with the cwd, and only
   then send the bootstrap.
2. `bind-thread` to record each thread id (and `--cwd`), then send that member's bootstrap
   trigger as the thread's first message. The trigger is short on purpose: it tells the new
   thread to READ its `guide.md` and `team.json` rather than carrying the whole protocol inline.
3. Whenever you report, audit, reopen, or hand off a member thread, include the app deep link
   `codex://threads/<thread_id>` next to the raw id - worktree-backed threads are easy to lose
   in the sidebar without it. On a codex_app team, a spawned in-process agent is never a
   member substitute: it cannot carry the team title or be inspected, titled, archived, or
   re-opened with the `codex_app.*` tools this team runs on.

On either transport, a member only counts once it is bound (`bind-agent` / `bind-thread`). If
the selected transport's tools stop working mid-run, STOP and say so (see Stop rules); do not
quietly switch transports.

## Communication

Members push to you and to one another; you never poll them as a routine. The address book is
`team.json`, and the generated manual binds members to the hard rules, so you mainly keep the
channel open: expect frequent small inbound updates from each member - findings,
`WORKING:`/`BLOCKED:` markers, peer digests - rather than one final dump, and act on them as
they arrive.

- **MultiAgentV2:** members reach you with `send_message` to `/root` and reach peers by their
  `members[].agentPath`. You reach members the same way; use `followup_task` when you hand an
  idle member NEW work (it wakes the member), `send_message` for context that should not
  interrupt, and `wait_agent` only when you are genuinely blocked on their next update - a
  `wait_agent` timeout only means no new mailbox update arrived, never that a member failed.
  Your own session IS `/root` - members can always reach you; leave `--session` unset.
- **Codex App:** members push with `codex_app.send_message_to_thread`; you inspect state with
  `codex_app.read_thread`. So members can actually reach you, run `init` with
  `--session <your own thread id>` - that makes `leader.sessionId` in team.json a real,
  messageable thread; without it members cannot report to you and you are stuck polling.

All member-to-member and member-to-leader traffic is in English; when the END user addresses a
member, that member replies in the user's own language. Members hand off files and memos
through the team `artifacts/` directory and reference them by path.

## Let members work - do not rush them

Members heartbeat every few tool calls and message you on every finding, blocker, and finished
slice (their manual binds them to this). So a member that is quiet between heartbeats is **working,
not stalled** - a stretch of silence is the normal sound of focused work, not a problem to chase.
Re-reading a calm member's state, or sending "any update?" / "are you done?" / "hurry up" pings,
interrupts that member and slows the whole team. Trust the heartbeat and let them cook.

Message a member only when one of these is true:
- you have new information, context, or a correction it needs to do its slice right;
- you are reassigning, narrowing, or unblocking its scope;
- a peer's result changes what it should do; or
- it has gone fully silent well past its heartbeat cadence AND that stall is blocking the team -
  then send one specific question, not a barrage.

Otherwise stay calm and keep the channel open: read inbound updates as they arrive and act on them.
A long-running member is alive; a heartbeat you have not received yet is not a failure. Fallback only when
a member is completed without its deliverable, explicitly `BLOCKED:`, or no longer running - then
unblock, reassign, or re-task that slice instead of waiting on it. Wait for
every required member's final report before you declare the team done - rushing toward "done" while
members are still mid-slice just produces half-built work you will have to redo.

## Worktrees - isolate members who would touch the same files

The moment two members' slices would edit the same files, give each its own git worktree so they
cannot clobber each other. Decide this whenever you see the collision - at team creation OR mid-run,
not only up front. For each colliding member run `worktree-add --team <id> --id <member>`: it creates
the worktree off the base branch on a derived branch, flips the team into worktree mode, records it in
`team.json`, and prints the `cd` path to hand that member. The member works and commits only inside
its own worktree. To land the work, `integrate --team <id>` merges every member branch into your
current branch with a merge commit (never a squash or rebase); resolve any conflict it reports, then
`worktree-remove` each worktree at cleanup.

Delivering the path differs by transport: on MultiAgentV2, create the worktree BEFORE spawning
so the bootstrap carries it, or send it to an already-running member as a `followup_task`; on
Codex App, send a follow-up message that includes both the worktree path and the member's
`codex://threads/<thread_id>` link. Either way, run `bind-agent`/`bind-thread` with
`--cwd <worktree>` (or `--worktree-path`) so `team.json`, `guide.md`, `status`, and
`member-prompt` all point at the same worktree-backed member.

When the member starts inside a worktree, it must verify the assigned cwd exists and contains the
repository checkout before editing. If the directory is missing, empty, or does not look like a git
worktree/repository yet, the member reports `BLOCKED: worktree not ready` to the leader and waits
instead of editing a parent checkout or an empty directory.

## Run a ulw-plan in parallel

When a decision-complete plan already exists at `.omo/plans/<slug>.md` (from ulw-plan), execute its
parallel waves as a team instead of one todo at a time. Map it directly:
- one wave's independent todos -> one member each; the todo's scope/files become that member's `focus`,
  and its acceptance criteria + QA become the member's `deliverable`.
- the plan's dependency matrix sets the shape: todos with no unmet dependency inside a wave run as
  concurrent members; a todo that depends on another waits, so launch the next wave only after the
  blocking members report.
- todos in the same wave that touch overlapping files -> give those members worktrees (see above).

Keep the plan file as the shared spec: point each member at its todo by path, and verify the member's
result against that todo's acceptance criteria before you integrate.

## Archive, delete, and cleanup

DISBAND the team the moment it is no longer needed. A team exists only to do its work; once that
work is done, or the user no longer wants it, do not leave it lying around - archive every member,
then delete the team state only after archival evidence is clean or preserved. A finished team that
is never disbanded is a leak.

- `archive` closes the team: notify each active member, copy anything useful into `artifacts/`,
  then close each member on its transport. On MultiAgentV2, `interrupt_agent` any member still
  mid-turn and record in the note that V2 exposes no runtime archive operation - the durable
  `team.json` state IS the archive; never claim a V2 agent itself was archived. On Codex App,
  try `codex_app.set_thread_archived` per member thread; treat failures such as
  "Ambiguous Codex thread id" or an id that is ambiguous across hosts as an
  app-thread archival blocker, not as a team-state blocker: record the failure in the team log,
  tell the user which member thread was not proven archived, and continue the team-state archive
  with `archive --note "<blocker>"`. Never pretend a member thread was archived. Do not delete the
  team state after an app-thread archival blocker unless the evidence has been copied elsewhere or
  the user explicitly accepts that evidence loss.
- `delete` removes `.omo/teams/{session_id}` and refuses while the team is unarchived or any member
  is still active unless `--force`.
- When the work wraps up, land it the way the user asked: `integrate --team <id>` for a direct merge
  commit, or push each member branch and open a PR. Then `worktree-remove` each worktree, archive, and
  delete. Cleanup is real work; respect the user's instruction on how to land it.

## Stop rules

- Stop and ask before deleting an unarchived team while any member is still active.
- Member communication stays English unless the user explicitly requests otherwise; user-facing
  replies follow the user's language.
- Stop if the selected transport's tools (V2 spawn/message/wait/list/interrupt, or Codex App
  create/read/send/title/archive) stop working mid-run; say so instead of faking it or silently
  switching transports. Pre-init absence is not a stop - it routes to the plain-subagent split.
