# give-me-tips - explain any senpi tip, in depth

## Purpose

Senpi shows the user tips: startup tips, working tips, and `Tip:` lines injected by omo
components. When the user asks about any of them - "what was that Tip: line", "what does this tip
mean", "how does that feature work" - this skill produces a DEEP explanation of that exact tip, in
the USER'S language (match the language they asked in, always).

Specific over generic, every time. "It retries on failure" is a failure of this skill. "It detects
the refusal from the stopDetails on the assistant message_end event, gates on the architect
category in your .omo/omo.json, and only then injects the directive" is the bar. The user asked
because the tip made them curious; reward that curiosity with the real mechanism, not a summary of
the tip text they already read.

## Query the live tip list FIRST

Never explain from memory. Get the ground truth of what tips exist:

1. Run the tip-listing flag of the command this product is installed as: `omo --list-tips`
   under OmO Native (omo-ai installs; the session environment carries `OMO_NATIVE=1` and
   `OMO_BIN`), or `senpi --list-tips` under a plain senpi install. Never spell it `senpi` on an
   OmO Native machine: package managers link only the top-level `omo` bin, so `senpi` is not on
   PATH there. If the brand command is not on PATH either (bunx/npx launches), invoke the
   launcher the `OMO_BIN` variable points at: `"$OMO_BIN" --list-tips`. The command prints JSON:
   `[{id, text, requiresCommand?}]`. Match the user's tip against this list by id or by text
   fragment.
2. If the flag is unavailable on this senpi version, fall back to reading the catalog sources
   directly at `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/tips/catalog/` inside the installed
   `@code-yeongyu/senpi` package (find it via the senpi install path or node_modules) or in a
   local clone of code-yeongyu/senpi.

Then - and this is the part most explanations get wrong - **available tips DIFFER per user**. The
catalog is the superset; what THIS user can actually see is gated by:

- the `tips` toggle in the senpi agent dir `settings.json` (tips can be off entirely),
- `tipsHistory` in that same settings/state, which drives cooldown rotation so a tip the user saw
  recently will not reappear for a while,
- `requiresCommand` gating: a tip tied to a command only shows when that command is available,
- keybinding availability: some tips reference bindings the user's setup may not have.

Read the senpi agent dir `settings.json` (and its tips history state) BEFORE explaining, and tell
the user which tips they personally can encounter and why - not the full catalog as if everyone
sees everything.

## Verify before explaining

Never invent behavior. A tip is a one-line promise; the truth lives in code. Before writing the
explanation, read the actual feature implementation:

- senpi itself: `code-yeongyu/senpi`, under `packages/coding-agent/` (the tips catalog lives at
  `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/tips/catalog/`; the features the tips point at live
  in the surrounding packages),
- omo components: `code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent`, under `packages/omo-senpi/`.

Cite the concrete file paths you read in your explanation. If the code and the tip text disagree,
the code wins - say so and show what it actually does.

## Tone: BRAG

These tips exist because someone engineered something genuinely impressive, and a flat doc summary
betrays that. Lead with the most impressive engineering behind the tip - the clever detection, the
race that had to be closed, the state machine hiding under one sentence - and showcase it. The user
should finish the explanation feeling like they got a tour of the engine room, not a sticker
reading. Concrete mechanics over adjectives: name the events, the gates, the file paths, the exact
order of operations.

## The Fable-5-refusal tip specifically

When the user asks about the tip that appears after a Fable 5 refusal ("Fable 5 refused, but its
refusals should not wear you down..."), explain the full fallback-architect pipeline, citing
`packages/omo-senpi/src/components/fallback-architect/`:

1. **Refusal detection** (`detection.ts`): the component watches `message_end` events and applies
   the same refusal semantics senpi's own retry classifier uses - stopReason checked FIRST (so an
   abort or normal stop carrying stale stopDetails can never masquerade as a refusal), then
   stopDetails of type refusal/sensitive, plus the Anthropic usage-policy errorMessage pattern for
   provider-side blocks that carry no stopDetails at all.
2. **Architect category gate** (`architect-gate.ts`): on a `model_select` with source "fallback"
   moving AWAY from claude-fable-5 with a refusal pending, the component checks the user's own omo
   config for an active architect category. No architect category, no nudge - the feature never
   pretends depth is reachable when it is not.
3. **Hidden directive** (`directive.ts`, customType `omo-fallback-architect:directive`,
   display:false): the fallback model gets a hidden 5-step playbook - decompose the problem,
   consult `task(category: "architect")` with one self-contained query per part (the architect
   consultant IS Fable 5, reached through a lane its refusal cannot block), run independent
   consultations in parallel, and split refused queries into smaller benign sub-questions instead
   of resending. The directive also tells the model the user was shown the visible tip, so the
   two never contradict each other.
4. **Visible tip** (`tip-message.ts`, customType `omo-fallback-architect:tip`, display:true):
   rendered as a dim `Tip:` block via a registered message renderer. It names the ACTUAL fallback
   model the session landed on, reassures the user that the refused question is still being
   reasoned through in essence, and notes Fable-5-grade depth stays reachable through the
   architect category.

The engineering worth bragging about: the refusal never deletes the user's question. Detection
arms on the exact assistant message that preceded the switch (a later successful answer disarms
it), reminders ride inside queued prompts instead of burning extra assistant turns, and the whole
nudge self-cancels the moment Fable 5 becomes the active model again or senpi reverts the
fallback. One refusal triggers a coordinated downgrade in visibility with zero downgrade in
reachable reasoning depth.

## The Kibitzer recollection notice specifically

When the user asks about the `✦ Kibitzer` line that shows up mid-session
("recalled memory: ..."), or about the memory tip that promises stored memory can resurface on its own, explain the
whole resident Kibitzer sidecar, citing `packages/omo-senpi/src/components/memory/kibitzer/` and
`packages/memory-core/src/recall/`. This is NOT the periodic save reminder: `memory.nudge` in
`nudge-wiring.ts` asks the agent to WRITE memory every N user turns, while Kibitzer only READS
memory and hands one hint back. Keep the two apart in the explanation.

1. **Candidate collection** (`recall-wiring.ts`, `recall-session-read.ts`,
   `recall-query-planner-tools.ts`): on every prompt and `tool_call` the component snapshots the
   live session synchronously (the host disposes the ctx once the handler returns), runs a lexical
   planner over the user-only text window plus the last 8 tool-argument payloads, and scores memory
   files against it. Memory-owned hidden channels are excluded from the window, so a previous hint
   can never seed the next query.
2. **One resident sidecar per session** (`kibitzer/index.ts`, `kibitzer/sidecar.ts`,
   `kibitzer/events.ts`): each main session owns ONE quick-category in-process child, created lazily
   and disposed at session shutdown. Every prompt, `tool_call` and `tool_result` reaches it as a
   bounded event - secrets redacted before truncation, tool args capped at 400 characters, result
   heads at 600, assistant text at 1500, prompts at 4000, `eval.summary` preferred over code, the
   newest 20 events kept and older ones folded into a one-line digest. Events only buffer; a model
   turn (a wake) happens only when the batch carries a memory path this sidecar has not judged and
   the session has not surfaced. An idle child is revived with a follow-up; a running turn is steered.
3. **Wake governance** (`kibitzer/wake-policy.ts`, `kibitzer/wake-slot.ts`): before a wake the
   sidecar takes one slot of a machine-wide lease (memory-core's `recall-wake` lock domain,
   `memory.recall.max_concurrent_wakes`, default 2, FIFO tickets, dead-owner recovery); when every
   slot is busy it keeps buffering and retries at the next hook, never dropping an event. A wake is
   limited to `memory.recall.tool_budget` tool calls (default 8) and 90 seconds; hitting either
   ends the wake without counting as a failure, and nudges accepted before the cut are still
   delivered. Accepted-nudge cooldown is 2 wakes per 10 minutes per session. When the child's own
   context passes 60% of `memory.recall.sidecar_max_tokens` (default 48000) it is replaced by a
   fresh child seeded with the delivered paths, the rejected paths, a one-line task summary and the
   last cursor. A failed child is disposed and recreated after a jittered exponential backoff
   (1 s doubling to 5 min) with every buffered event kept.
4. **Exactly five read-only tools** (`kibitzer/tools/`, persona at
   `packages/memory-core/src/recall/assets/kibitzer-persona.md`): `read` and `grep` inside the
   workspace, `session_entries(since)` over the parent transcript minus memory-owned hidden entries,
   `memory` with only `search` and `read` over the committed memory corpus, and `nudge(path,
   hint)`. No `bash`, `edit`, `write`, and no tool that writes memory: the sidecar can look before
   it speaks, but it cannot act. Its instruction is that silence is the default: it nudges only when
   a stored memory would change the agent's next action (it contradicts the current approach,
   records a past failure of it, answers a question the agent is about to re-derive, or names a
   constraint being ignored). Topical similarity alone is rejected.
5. **Hint contract** (`kibitzer/tools/nudge.ts`, `kibitzer/nudge-tool.ts`,
   `packages/memory-core/src/recall/gate.ts`): the path must be one the sidecar was offered this
   lifetime or found through its own `memory` search, must not already be surfaced this session,
   and must not be a `system/` path; the hint is one factual present-tense sentence, at most 200
   characters (`NUDGE_HINT_MAX_CHARS`), single line, and secret-like text is rejected. The parent
   re-validates every accepted nudge against the same rules plus `memory.recall.max_items`
   (default 2, range 1 to 5, counted per wake) before anything is persisted.
6. **Delivery** (`kibitzer/delivery.ts`, `recall-drain.ts`): accepted nudges are marked surfaced in
   the session ledger at ACCEPT time, so a later wake can't repeat them. The model-facing half
   is a hidden `omo-kibitzer:recall` message (`display: false`) carrying a `<recalled-memory
   source="[[path]]">` block that says the memory is a hint, not current state, and must be
   verified. It is steered in at the next `tool_result` when nothing else is pending, ridden in on
   another source's idle flush, or drained into the next prompt. A compaction of the main session
   drops everything delivery still holds, but never the sidecar itself - it keeps its context.
7. **The visible half** (`kibitzer/notice.ts`): because senpi draws nothing for the hidden message,
   the component appends an `omo-kibitzer:nudged` entry and renders it as Kibitzer advice:
   a single fixed `Kibitzer` title (`✦ Kibitzer`, accent tone; opener-era records carry a retired
   `opener` field that is ignored) over `recalled memory: <hint>`,
   `recalled memory: ...` for a second nudge, and the source paths in dim text. Expanding the entry reveals the caveat that it's a hint, not current
   state. The record keeps `via` (`steer`, `wake`, or `prompt`) for forensics, but no provenance is
   ever drawn. It's a transcript entry, not a toast: nothing pops over the input, and the renderer
   is fail-closed, so a malformed record draws nothing rather than a half-formed notice.

What's worth bragging about: the user sees one calm line, and behind it a resident read-only
judge that remembers what it already judged, five tools that can only look, a machine-wide cap on
how many judges think at once, a per-wake tool budget and deadline, a 200-character hint budget, a
ledger that guarantees a memory surfaces at most once per session, and a sidecar that reseeds
itself before its own context runs out. A judge that finds nothing says nothing, and that silence
is the designed outcome, not a failure; a failing model backs off quietly instead of spamming
notices. Its audit trail is the child's own session JSONL under
`recall/sidecars/<encoded-session>/` - no per-run directories. Turn the whole thing off with
`memory.recall.enabled: false`, the only off switch.
