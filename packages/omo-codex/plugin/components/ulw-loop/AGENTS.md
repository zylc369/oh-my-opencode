# Repository Conventions

Conventions for human contributors and AI agents working on this repository.

## Stack

- Node >=20 runtime.
- npm package manager.
- TypeScript 6 strict mode.
- Biome 2 linting and formatting.
- Vitest 4 test runner.

## Forbidden

- No `as any` or `as unknown`.
- No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`.
- No enums.
- No non-null assertions.
- No default exports. `vitest.config.ts` is exempt because the framework requires that shape.

## File Ceiling

- Keep each `src/` TypeScript file under 250 pure LOC.
- Split by responsibility before a file reaches the ceiling.

## Test Discipline

- Use Vitest with nested `describe` names in `#given`, `#when`, and `#then` form, or inline `// given`, `// when`, and `// then` comments.
- Never use Arrange-Act-Assert comments.
- Keep fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.

## Commit Style

- Use Conventional Commits.
- Keep commits atomic.
- Each commit's tests and build must pass on its own.

## Branding

- Repo artifacts live under `.omo/ulw-loop/` paths.
- Environment variables use the `OMO_ULW_LOOP_*` prefix.
- CLI commands use the `omo ulw-loop` form.
- Do not use any alternate legacy CLI alias anywhere.

## Build and Hooks

- Build output goes to `dist/`.
- `hooks/hooks.json` runs `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js hook user-prompt-submit --with-ultrawork`.
