Codex plugin component for durable repo-native multi-goal orchestration with embedded success criteria and observable evidence audit. State lives under `.omo/ulw-loop/` and is mutated through the `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop` CLI.

## CLI

Every subcommand below is implemented. Pass `--json` where supported for machine-readable output, and pass `--session-id <id>` or set `OMO_ULW_LOOP_SESSION_ID` to scope state to a parallel session.

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop help` | Print CLI usage. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop create-goals` | Create repo-native goals and seed success criteria from a brief; optionally define review-boundary validation batches with `--validation-batch-json`. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop status` | Report active goal, criteria, and evidence state. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop complete-goals` | Manual fallback to start or resume the next eligible goal, or report aggregate completion / blocked handoff. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop checkpoint` | Gate a goal transition with evidence; complete checkpoints auto-start the next eligible goal by default, with `--no-advance` preserving the legacy two-call flow. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop steer` | Apply one steering mutation proposal or an atomic all-or-nothing batch with `--proposals-json`. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop add-goal` | Append a goal to the active plan. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop criteria` | Inspect one goal's success criteria. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop record-evidence` | Record observable evidence for one criterion. |
| `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop record-review-blockers` | Mark a goal as review-blocked and add follow-up work from final-review findings. |

The final quality gate parsed by `checkpoint` requires `manualQa`, `gateReview`, `iteration`, and `criteriaCoverage`; lazycodex accepts optional `codeReview`. Lazycodex defaults to `main-session` self-review, with `category:*` and reviewer acceptors available when needed. `criteriaCoverage` records the original intent, desired outcome, user-facing outcome review, pass counts, and covered adversarial classes. The companion `codex-goal-json` must contain `goal.objective` equal to the plan's `codexObjective` verbatim.

A complete passing checkpoint uses both payloads:

```json
{"goal":{"objective":"Ship the requested behavior","status":"complete"}}
```

```json
{"gateReview":{"by":"main-session","recommendation":"APPROVE","reportPath":".omo/evidence/gate-review.md","evidence":"Gate review passed.","blockers":[],"notes":[]},"manualQa":{"by":"lazycodex-qa-executor","status":"passed","evidence":"Manual QA passed.","surfaceEvidence":[{"id":"cli","criterionRef":"C1","surface":"cli","invocation":"omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop checkpoint --json","verdict":"passed","artifactRefs":["cli-artifact"]}],"adversarialCases":[{"id":"malformed","criterionRef":"C2","scenario":"Malformed input","expectedBehavior":"Rejected","verdict":"not_applicable","reason":"Not triggered","artifactRefs":["cli-artifact"]}],"artifactRefs":[{"id":"cli-artifact","kind":"cli-transcript","description":"Passing CLI transcript","path":".omo/evidence/cli.txt"}]},"codeReview":{"by":"lazycodex-code-reviewer","recommendation":"APPROVE","codeQualityStatus":"CLEAR","reportPath":".omo/evidence/code-review.md","evidence":"Code review passed.","blockers":[]},"iteration":{"fullRerun":true,"status":"passed","rerunCommands":["bun test"],"evidence":"Full rerun passed."},"criteriaCoverage":{"totalCriteria":2,"passCount":2,"originalIntent":"Ship the requested behavior","desiredOutcome":"The behavior works for users.","userOutcomeReview":"The result matches the requested outcome.","adversarialClassesCovered":["malformed_input"]}}
```

Validation batches are optional review boundaries declared at plan creation with `--validation-batch-json '[{"batchId":"VB001","memberIds":[...],"finalGoalId":"..."}]'`. The batch-final goal cannot complete until every other member is complete or superseded-resolved, every member criterion is pass, and a quality gate's coverage counts match the recomputed member criteria. Steering split/supersede mutations keep batch membership consistent and record `batch_updated`.

## Codex Plugin

This directory is a component of the aggregate `@sisyphuslabs/omo-codex-plugin` root. Plugin discovery (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) is owned by that aggregate root, not by this component. The component ships:

- `hooks/hooks.json` registering four hooks:
  - `UserPromptSubmit` -> `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js" hook user-prompt-submit --with-ultrawork`
  - `PreToolUse` matching `^create_goal$` -> `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js" hook pre-tool-use`
  - `PreToolUse` matching the spawn tool tokens -> `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js" hook pre-tool-use-spawn` (fan-out cap + gate-artifact preflight)
  - `Stop` -> `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js" hook stop` (auto-resume with a two-strike no-progress cap)
- `skills/ulw-loop/` for the bundled `ulw-loop` skill.
- `directive.md`, the ultrawork directive read at runtime when `--with-ultrawork` falls back to the full text. This package is published standalone and takes no dependency on `@oh-my-opencode/prompts-core`, so it intentionally bundles its own byte-identical copy of the canonical `packages/prompts-core/prompts/ultrawork/codex.md`. The copy is generated by `components/ultrawork/scripts/sync-directive.mjs` and pinned byte-for-byte by `test/ultrawork-directive.test.ts`; do not hand-edit it.
- `bin.omo-ulw-loop` -> `dist/cli.js` for standalone CLI invocation.

This component ships a CLI, a skill, and hooks. It does not expose an MCP server.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run check
npm pack --dry-run
```

`npm test` runs Vitest, `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run check` runs typecheck, Biome, and the build.

## Local Codex Installation

```bash
npx lazycodex-ai install
```

The installer builds and copies the plugin into `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/0.1.0`, registers the `sisyphuslabs` marketplace from the `lazycodex` Git repository, installs runtime dependencies there, and enables:

```toml
[features]
plugins = true
plugin_hooks = true

[plugins."omo@sisyphuslabs"]
enabled = true
```

## Privacy

This component runs locally and does not call a network service by itself.
