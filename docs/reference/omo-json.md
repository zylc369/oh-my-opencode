# omo.json Configuration Reference

`omo.json` (or `omo.jsonc`) is the single harness-spanning configuration surface owned by [`@oh-my-opencode/omo-config-core`](../../packages/omo-config-core/AGENTS.md). It is the only config file read by the OpenCode plugin, by the Senpi adapter (task, config-watch), and by Codex. The legacy OpenCode-family files (`oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]`) and `~/.omo/config.jsonc` are read by nothing but the migration engine (see [Migration from legacy files](#migration-from-legacy-files)).

Files may be JSONC: `//` comments and trailing commas are allowed. Strict typed blocks never silently accept a malformed value: the value is ignored and reported, and every valid key beside it keeps working. Unknown keys are ignored the same way with an `unknown-keys` diagnostic (see [Safety and failure handling](#file-locations-and-precedence)), so neither a retired or mistyped key nor one wrong value costs you the rest of the file. The `[opencode]` block is intentionally a freeform record so it can carry the full plugin configuration.

## File locations and precedence

The loader resolves layers in `resolveOmoConfigPaths` and folds them lowest-to-highest, so the **last** layer merged wins (`packages/omo-config-core/src/loader/paths.ts`, `loader.ts`).

1. **User layer (lowest precedence).** `omo.jsonc`, falling back to `omo.json`, under `~/.omo` on every platform. This is the same root that already holds omo runtime state (`teams/`, `rules/`, `plans/`, `lsp-daemon/`), so there is one user-scope omo directory and one only.
2. **Project layers.** `.omo/omo.jsonc` (then `.omo/omo.json`) in every directory from the current working directory up to `$HOME`. Farther ancestors are merged first; the **nearest** project file has the highest precedence and beats the user layer. `$HOME` itself is skipped by this walk, because `~/.omo` is already the user layer and must not be counted twice.

Merge rules (`loader/merge.ts`):

- Plain objects deep-merge recursively.
- Scalars and arrays replace the lower layer wholesale.
- `__proto__`, `prototype`, and `constructor` keys are stripped from both merge keys and nested values (prototype-pollution guard).

Safety and failure handling:

- A symlinked project `.omo` directory or a symlinked project config file is skipped as a load source (`loader/paths.ts`).
- A missing or unreadable file, a file that is not valid JSONC, or a file whose root is not an object becomes an entry in the result's `diagnostics` and is skipped; loading continues.
- Unrecognized keys anywhere in a layer are ignored and reported through an `unknown-keys` diagnostic that names each dotted key path (for example `profiles.opus.retired_key`).
- A malformed value in any section (the shared top level, `task`, `agents`, `categories`, `teams`, the `[native]` / `[senpi]` / `[codex]` blocks, `profiles`) is dropped on its own: the loader removes only the smallest failing subtree (the wrong value itself, or the object that lacks a required key), keeps every valid sibling at every depth, and reports each dropped key as its own `invalid-value` diagnostic (for example `task.host_engine_policy` or `teams.alpha.members.0.color`). `omo doctor` prints one line per dropped key, for example `WARN config: ~/.omo/omo.jsonc: task.host_engine_policy ignored (invalid value)`; the OpenCode edition's doctor lists the same line as a warning. The OpenCode plugin applies the same rule to the `[opencode]` block against its own schema.
- A file with nothing valid left after pruning contributes nothing and keeps its `validation` diagnostic, as does a file carrying a `__proto__`, `prototype`, or `constructor` key at any depth (checked before anything is pruned).
- If the merged config fails final validation (a partial team spec that no layer completes, for example), the failing merged values are dropped the same way with an `invalid-value` diagnostic whose path is `(merged omo config)`; only when that cannot settle does the loader return the all-default config plus one `validation` diagnostic instead of throwing (`loader/loader.ts`).

## `$schema`

The root schema accepts an optional `$schema` string key (`packages/omo-config-core/src/schema/config.ts`, on both `OmoConfigSchema` and `OmoConfigLayerSchema`); both the per-layer parse (`OmoConfigLayerSchema.safeParse`) and the final merged parse (`OmoConfigSchema.safeParse` in `packages/omo-config-core/src/loader/loader.ts`) carry it through and otherwise ignore it, so an editor pointer is safe to add.

A generated JSON schema artifact ships at `assets/omo.schema.json`, produced from `OmoConfigSchema` by the root `build:omo-schema` script (`script/build-omo-schema.ts`, `script/build-omo-schema-document.ts`); run `bun run build:omo-schema` to regenerate it. Point your editor at the raw dev-branch URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/assets/omo.schema.json
```

## Resolution order

After the file layers merge, each harness resolves its own view out of the merged document (`packages/omo-config-core/src/loader/resolution.ts`). Later layers win:

1. **Shared base keys** (every top-level key except `profiles` and the bracketed harness blocks).
2. **The `[harness]` block** for the current harness: `[opencode]`, `[native]`, or `[codex]`.
3. **`profiles.<name>`** for the active profile.
4. **`profiles.<name>.[harness]`** for the active profile.

Schema defaults apply once at the very end, after all four layers fold. Control keys (`profiles`, `[opencode]`, `[native]`, `[codex]`, and the legacy `[senpi]` spelling) never leak into the resolved view. Activating a profile that does not exist yields a `profile` diagnostic and the base configuration.

### Profile activation

The active profile name comes from (`resolveOmoProfileName`), highest priority first:

1. `OMO_PROFILE`
2. `OCX_PROFILE` (set by `ocx oc -p <name>`)
3. An `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` whose lexical tail is `profiles/<name>`
4. None (no profile layer applied)

No default profiles ship. A profile exists only when you write one under `profiles.<name>` or the migration derives one from a legacy OpenCode profile directory.

### Harness blocks

`[opencode]` is a freeform record: it carries the full OpenCode plugin configuration documented in [`docs/reference/configuration.md`](./configuration.md) (background tasks, tmux, hooks, skills, and every other plugin key), and the strict schema does not validate its contents. `[native]` and `[codex]` are typed blocks accepting the shared base keys (`categories`, `agents`, `git_master`, `task`, `teams`, `models`, `model_profiles`, `model_profile`, `memory`, `telemetry`, `disabled_skills`), so a harness-specific override stays schema-checked.

`[senpi]` is the legacy spelling of `[native]`, kept working for one release line. It is canonicalized to `[native]` when the config is read, so a config that cannot be rewritten still applies every value it sets, and the startup migration rewrites the key in the file once, naming it in a notice. When a file carries both blocks, `[native]` wins and the ignored `[senpi]` block is reported as a deprecation diagnostic.

### `disabled_skills` (every harness)

The one supported way to turn a skill off. A name listed here is absent from the run: on OmO Native / Senpi it never enters the `<available_skills>` index, the `/skill:` commands, or `get_commands`; on the OpenCode plugin it is dropped from the builtin set and the skill tool. On OmO Native it also covers the skills a feature contributes on its own, `computer-use` and `x-search`: the skill is gone and its tool stays. Unlike other arrays, layers are unioned: the shared base, the `[harness]` block, the user file, the project file, and the active profile all add names, and a project cannot re-enable a skill the user file disabled by omitting it.

```jsonc
// ~/.omo/omo.jsonc
{
  "disabled_skills": ["frontend", "visual-qa"]
}
```

Security invariant: the OpenCode plugin honors `mcp_env_allowlist` and `browser_automation_engine.playwright_mcp_args` only from the user layer, including the user layer's own active profile block. Project layers cannot extend them.

### `telemetry` (Native harness)

The optional `telemetry` block controls OmO Native product telemetry in Senpi. `telemetry.enabled` is a boolean and defaults to `true`, so telemetry ships enabled. Set it to `false` to turn telemetry off. This setting applies only to OmO Native.

```jsonc
{
  "[native]": {
    "telemetry": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

The block may also appear at the shared top level or in profile layers and follows the normal resolution order. Because typed config objects are strict, an older `@oh-my-opencode/omo-config-core` version that predates this key rejects a file containing `telemetry` instead of ignoring it. See [Mixed-version compatibility](#mixed-version-compatibility) before sharing one config across versions.

### `memory` (Native harness)

The optional `memory` block configures the Senpi memory subsystem (`schema/memory.ts` `OmoMemorySettingsSchema`). Keys: `enabled` (default `true`), `agent` (default `"auto"`), the sub-blocks `reflection`, `nudge`, `recall` (the resident, read-only Kibitzer sidecar behind `recalled memory:` notices - one per main session, prompt and tool-call triggered, nudge-only output, no memory writes: `enabled` as the only off switch, `max_items` per wake, `category` defaulting to `quick`, `event_caps` defaulting to `{ tool_args: 400, result_head: 600, assistant: 1500, prompt: 4000 }` for its redacted event feed, `sidecar_max_tokens` defaulting to `48000` with a proactive reseed at 60%, `max_concurrent_wakes` defaulting to `2` as the machine-wide wake lease, and `tool_budget` defaulting to `8` read-only tool calls per wake), `facts`, `dream`, `people`, `soul`, `write_notice`, `sync`, `search`, plus `compile_warn_tokens` and per-agent overrides under `agents`. These recall keys can be set at the shared root, harness/profile layer, or per-agent override; layer values are deep-partial and later layers win.

Reflection children start without extensions so they stay fast. When the reflection model belongs to a provider that only an extension registers (a custom gateway declared under `packages` in `settings.json`, for example), omo detects that the model is missing from the extension-free model list and starts that child with extensions loaded instead; the child still keeps its own memory component off. If no child can see the model even with extensions loaded, automatic reflection pauses after that first failure and shows one notice. To fix it, point `categories.<category>.model` (or `memory.reflection.category`) at a model from a core provider, or set `memory.reflection.enabled` to `false`. `/reflect` retries at once, and the paused state is probed again every six hours.

### `git_master` (Native harness)

The optional `git_master` block controls commit attribution in Senpi (`schema/git-master.ts`). When the agent works with the `git-master` skill — reading it in the main session or loading it into a task child via `load_skills` — omo appends a commit-footer directive to the skill content only when you opt in.

Commit-identity contract: commits omo causes in your repository carry your own git `user.name` / `user.email` as author and committer, and omo never adds a `Co-authored-by` trailer or any other GitHub-resolvable automation identity. A default install appends nothing.

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `commit_footer` | boolean \| string | `false` | Opt in to the "Ultraworked with [omo](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent)" footer in the commit body. A string replaces the builtin footer text. |
| `include_co_authored_by` | boolean | `false` | Deprecated no-op, accepted so existing configs keep validating. omo does not emit a `Co-authored-by` trailer regardless of this value. |

To opt in to the body footer:

```jsonc
{
  "git_master": {
    "commit_footer": true
  }
}
```

The block may live at the shared top level, in `[native]`, or in profile layers, and follows the normal resolution order. The OpenCode plugin keeps its own `git_master` key inside the freeform `[opencode]` block (see [configuration.md](./configuration.md)); this typed section applies to the Native harness.

### `models` (shared catalog)

A record of short name to catalog entry (`schema/model-catalog.ts`). The canonical strict shape is `{ model, reasoning? }`. Deprecated `variant` and `reasoningEffort` inputs remain accepted and are normalized to `reasoning`; other tuning fields are not catalog-entry keys.

```jsonc
{
  "models": {
    "opus": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5", "reasoning": "max" },
    "fast": { "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5" }
  },
  "categories": {
    "deep-low": { "model": "opus" },          // resolves to anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 at reasoning max
    "quick": { "model": "fast", "reasoning": "high" } // site tuning wins over the entry
  }
}
```

When an agent or category `model` string matches a catalog key, resolution (`models/model-reference-resolution.ts`) swaps in the entry's model id and fills any unset `reasoning` from the entry. Tuning written at the use site always wins. A `[harness]` block (or a profile) can override individual catalog entries for its own view. Catalog cycles are detected and reported as `model_catalog_cycle` diagnostics instead of looping.

### Model profiles (Native harness)

A model profile is a named, ordered model chain you pick by lane (Daily / Geeky × Normal / Heavy) instead of by model id. Two keys drive it (`schema/model-profile.ts`, `schema/config.ts`):

| Key | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `model_profiles` | record<string, `{ display_name?: string; family?: "daily" \| "geeky"; tier?: "normal" \| "heavy"; models?: model entries }`> | Named chains. `models` entries are the same shape as a category chain: a bare string (`provider/model`, a bare model id, either with an optional `:level` reasoning suffix) or `{ model, reasoning?, ... }`. Fields are optional; the object is strict. `family` / `tier` are metadata only. |
| `model_profile` | string | Which chain drives the main session model. Either a lane id (`daily-normal`) or a literal `provider/model` (`anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`). A value containing `/` is a pin, so the pin and the profile share one key. |

This is not the `profiles` key. `profiles.<name>` is a config-layer overlay activated by `OMO_PROFILE` (see [Profile activation](#profile-activation)): it changes which configuration is loaded. `model_profiles` and `model_profile` are ordinary base keys inside that configuration: they change which model the main session starts on. A `profiles.<name>` layer may set `model_profile` like any other key, which is the one way the two meet.

Four builtin lanes ship (`packages/omo-senpi/src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`). Each rung lists every provider that serves the model, so a Copilot-only or gateway-only setup still resolves:

| Id | Display name | Chain |
|----|--------------|-------|
| `recommended` | Recommended (the unset default, not a lane) | `claude-opus-5-5` (medium) -> `claude-fable-5-1` (xhigh) -> `kimi-k3` (max) -> `gpt-6-astra` (xhigh) -> `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium, ChatGPT subscription/API) -> `gpt-6-sol` (medium) -> `glm-5.3` (max); ranked providers only, never a gateway aggregator |
| `daily-normal` | Daily · Normal | `claude-opus-5-5` (medium) -> `kimi-k3` (max) -> `glm-5.3` (max) |
| `daily-heavy` | Daily · Heavy | `claude-fable-5-1` (xhigh) |
| `geeky-normal` | Geeky · Normal | `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium, ChatGPT subscription/API), then `gpt-5.6-sol` (medium, ChatGPT subscription/API/Copilot/OpenCode) |
| `geeky-heavy` | Geeky · Heavy | `gpt-6-astra` (xhigh) |

GPT profiles use the same provider coverage as the corresponding task lanes:
ChatGPT subscription takes priority over the `openai` API/proxy lane. A user
profile can replace the candidate order and reasoning. Provider-qualified user
candidates stay on the named provider; an unavailable one advances only to the
next user-listed candidate, while a bare model id may match any provider.

What happens at session start (`packages/omo-senpi/src/components/model-profile/index.ts`, `resolve.ts`) in OmO Desktop and headless sessions. The interactive TUI does not apply `model_profile` yet; it keeps the model it started with.

- `model_profile` unset: Recommended is applied on a fresh session. The apply is not written back to config. Its rungs are served only by their ranked providers, so a gateway aggregator's copy of a model (for example OpenGateway's `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`) is never picked; the lanes keep their cross-provider fallback.
- A literal `provider/model`: that exact model is looked up in the live registry and applied.
- A profile id: the builtin table is overlaid with `model_profiles`, and the first rung the live registry can serve is applied. The notice names the lane, the pick, and the thinking level, for example `OmO Native: model profile "daily-normal" (Daily · Normal) selected anthropic-subscription/claude-opus-5-5 medium; mid-session fallback follows senpi's retry chains`.
- A rung counts for Recommended or a profile id only when its first turn could use it, which is resolved at session start: the provider's stored credential (per account when the provider holds several and the engine may rotate them - a pinned account is the only one that counts; with `providers.<id>.credentials.rotation: false` in `models.json` or a runtime API key only the default credential counts) and then the model's own request configuration. A saved login that can no longer be refreshed is skipped with the whole provider; a model whose configured headers do not resolve is skipped alone, and its siblings stay eligible. The notice names each skipped provider or model and the recovery for the current surface (`re-authenticate <provider> in Provider authentication settings` on the desktop, `/login <provider>` in an interactive session for a headless run); the raw error is never shown, `details.authFailed` carries `{ provider, model, reason }` with `reason` one of `refresh`, `credentials`, `request`. Each attempted account costs one credential resolution, sequentially (a rejected refresh waits for the provider's exchange timeout). A literal `provider/model` is applied without this check.
- No rung resolves: a notice lists the chain against this session's model registry and Senpi's default model stays. Absence from the registry is not reported as disconnected auth.
- Unknown id: `model_profile "<name>" is not defined; known profiles: ...`. Retired ids (`capable`, `deep-work`, `simple-work`) take this path; there is no alias.

The profile is applied only to a fresh session (`reason` is `startup` or `new`) whose model wasn't set explicitly: a `--model` flag, a scoped model, a resumed session, and a fork all keep their own model. Apply is session-scoped; it never writes `settings.json` or `omo.json`. Mid-session model failures follow Senpi's own `retry.fallbackChains`, not the profile chain.

Override semantics: a `model_profiles.<name>` entry that matches a builtin replaces it wholesale, with no per-field merge. `"daily-normal": { "display_name": "Best" }` therefore yields a profile with no models, reported at runtime as `defines no models`, rather than the builtin chain under a new label. Any other name adds a profile. Chain entries may name a `models.<catalog>` entry and expand through the same `resolveModelReferences` path as category chains; a profile named like a catalog entry gets a `shadows a model catalog entry` diagnostic. A bare string in `categories.*.models` or `agents.*.models` that equals a profile id gets a `splicing a profile into a category chain is not supported yet` diagnostic: profiles pick the main session model and never enter a delegated child's chain.

```jsonc
{
  "models": {
    "opus": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5", "reasoning": "max" }
  },
  "model_profiles": {
    "office": {
      "display_name": "Office hours",
      "models": ["opus", "openai/gpt-5.6-sol:medium"] // catalog alias, then a literal with a reasoning suffix
    }
  },
  "model_profile": "office" // or "daily-normal", or a pin such as "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5"
}
```

### `agents`

A record of agent name to definition (`schema/agent.ts`).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `description` | string | |
| `prompt` | string | |
| `model` | string | Sugar for a single-entry `models` list. |
| `models` | model entries | Ordered chain; each entry is a bare string or `{ model, reasoning?, temperature?, top_p?, max_tokens?, provider_options? }`. |
| `reasoning` | `off \| minimal \| low \| medium \| high \| xhigh \| max \| auto` \| string | Canonical reasoning field. |
| `tools` | record<string, boolean> | |
| `execution_mode` | `in-process \| process` | overrides `task.default_execution_mode`; curated builtin agents remain in-process |
| `background` | boolean | |
| `max_depth` | int >= 0 | |
| `allowed_subagents` | string[] | |
| `disallowed_tools` | string[] | |
| `max_turns` | int >= 0 | |
| `temperature` | number 0..2 | |
| `disable` | boolean | |

Deprecated keys accepted for back-compat and rewritten by migration:

| Old key | Replacement | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `variant` | `reasoning` | Reasoning level or harness-native preset token. |
| `reasoningEffort` | `reasoning` | `none` normalizes to `off`. |

These are the only deprecated keys the strict agent schema accepts. `textVerbosity`, `fallback_models`, `thinking`, and `maxTokens` are category / model-entry keys, not agent keys (see [Model references and model strings](#model-references-and-model-strings)).

#### Codex managed agent roles

In the Codex edition, `[codex].agents.<role>` (and `profiles.<P>.[codex].agents.<role>`) sets the model of a LazyCodex-managed agent role such as `explorer`, `librarian`, `plan`, `metis`, `momus`, or `lazycodex-worker-medium`. Every install and marketplace bootstrap writes `model` and `reasoning` into `$CODEX_HOME/agents/<role>.toml` (`reasoning` becomes `model_reasoning_effort`; `off` becomes `none`, `auto` keeps the bundled effort; a `gpt-6-luna:low` suffix is split the same way). Only the `[codex]` block counts: shared base `agents` hold OpenCode model ids and never reach Codex. Removing an entry returns the role to the bundled default on the next sync, and a role name LazyCodex does not manage produces a warning.

```jsonc
{
  "[codex]": {
    "agents": {
      "explorer": { "model": "gpt-6-luna", "reasoning": "low" },
      "librarian": { "model": "gpt-6-luna" }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Builtin agents

The Senpi task engine ships four builtin curated agents: `explore` and `librarian` are always spawnable through the task tool with zero configuration, for example `task(subagent_type: "explore", ...)`, while `plan-consultant` and `plan-reviewer` are plan-gated: spawnable only after the user requests the `ulw-plan` workflow, a `.omo/plans/*.md` artifact was touched, and `ulw-execute` was never invoked. They are read-only research and review specialists; implementation and orchestration agents stay category-routed (architecture consults go through `task(category: "architect")`).

> **Removed**: `agents.metis` / `agents.momus` and `subagent_type: "metis"|"momus"` no longer resolve to `plan-consultant` / `plan-reviewer`. The one-release alias window closed after 5.0.0-beta.51: a retired id is now an ordinary agent name, so a config key defines a custom agent and an undefined `subagent_type` fails as unknown. Rename them to the canonical ids. <!-- retired-name-allowed -->

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `explore` | Codebase search specialist. Answers "Where is X?", "Which file has Y?", "Find the code that does Z". Supports thoroughness levels from quick to very thorough. |
| `librarian` | Remote codebase and documentation research: searches open-source repositories, retrieves official documentation, and finds implementation examples via the GitHub CLI and direct documentation retrieval. |
| `plan-consultant` | Pre-planning consultant that analyzes requests to surface hidden intentions, ambiguities, and AI failure points. |
| `plan-reviewer` | Expert reviewer that evaluates work plans against clarity, verifiability, and completeness standards. |

Each builtin carries its own persona prompt, a read-only tool policy, and a per-agent model fallback chain, and is pinned to `execution_mode: "in-process"`. The nine-name allowlist includes a curated `bash` override, but it is not Senpi's general shell: it directly runs only validated read-only `gh` queries and HTTPS `curl` retrievals, with no shell parsing, redirects, output files, uploads, request bodies, or mutating HTTP methods. Direct `edit`, `write`, and mutating LSP tools are excluded.

Overriding a builtin. An `agents.<name>` entry matching a builtin overlays the builtin definition field by field: only the fields you set replace the builtin values, and every unset field keeps the builtin default. Names that do not match a builtin are appended as user-defined agents. To pin `explore` to a different model while keeping its builtin prompt and tool policy:

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "explore": { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5" }
  }
}
```

To hide a builtin from the task tool description and from spawn resolution, disable it:

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "plan-reviewer": { "disable": true }
  }
}
```

Overriding `execution_mode` on a curated agent is ignored. All other configured fields retain normal field-level overlay behavior, but curated agents remain in-process because the process runner cannot carry their persona instructions or tool policy. User-defined agents keep the configured execution mode.

Curated agents and teams. A team member spec naming a curated read-only agent (`kind: "subagent_type"`) is rejected at member validation with this error:

```
curated read-only agent "plan-reviewer" cannot be a team member; delegate via the task tool instead
```

Team members always spawn in `process` mode, which cannot carry the curated persona or tool policy, so delegate to these agents through the task tool instead of naming them as team members.

### `task`

Task engine settings. The whole object is optional, but `provider_concurrency`, `model_concurrency`, `state_dir`, `host_idle_exit_ms`, and `reattach_on_reconcile` are optional and remain unset when omitted (`schema/task.ts`).

`default_execution_mode: "auto"` (the default) defers the in-process/process choice to the session's own engine host: children run as sessions of that host when the platform is not Windows, `process_runner` is `host`, and the ensured host advertises `session_context` + `generation_handoff`; otherwise they run in-process. The decision is made ONCE per parent session, so a child's mode never changes because the host died later, and an explicit `in-process`/`process` always wins over it. Curated read-only agents (`explore`, `librarian`, `plan-consultant`, `plan-reviewer`) stay in-process regardless. `process_runner: "child-process"` keeps every process child in its own OS process (the only behaviour on Windows), `host_engine_policy` decides whether a daemon running a different engine build is handed over (`upgrade`) or left alone while children run as their own processes (`fallback`), and `host_idle_exit_ms` overrides the idle lifetime of a daemon this client starts. There is no socket key: each session's host socket is derived from the session (`<agentDir>/rpc/shards/p-<key>.sock`, or under `OMO_RPC_SHARD_ROOT`), and `rpc.sock` stays the operator endpoint; see [omo daemon](./omo-daemon.md).

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `default_execution_mode` | `auto \| in-process \| process` | `auto` |
| `process_runner` | `host \| child-process` | `host` |
| `host_engine_policy` | `upgrade \| fallback` | `upgrade` |
| `host_idle_exit_ms` | positive int | unset (the launch profile's tunable) |
| `default_concurrency` | non-negative int (0 = unlimited) | `5` |
| `provider_concurrency` | record<string, non-negative int (0 = unlimited)> | unset |
| `model_concurrency` | record<string, non-negative int (0 = unlimited)> | unset |
| `global_concurrency` | non-negative int (0 = unlimited) | effective default `max(8, availableParallelism() * 2)` |
| `max_depth` | int >= 0 | `1` |
| `residency_max_children` | non-negative int or `"unlimited"` (0 = unlimited) | `"unlimited"`: a parent keeps every child it started. Set a number to cap how many children one parent session keeps resident; at the cap the oldest finished idle child is evicted, and a spawn is refused only when every resident is still running. |
| `ttl_ms` | positive int | `86400000` (24h) |
| `state_dir` | string | unset (runtime uses `<agent dir>/projects/<folder>-<path hash>/senpi-task`) |
| `reattach_on_reconcile` | boolean | unset |
| `resume_children` | boolean | `true` |
| `warnings.unavailable_categories` | boolean | `true` |
| `wait.min_ms` | positive int | `5000` |
| `wait.default_ms` | positive int | `60000` |
| `wait.max_ms` | positive int | `600000` |
| `team.max_members` | int 1..8 | `8` |
| `team.max_parallel_members` | int 1..8 | `4` |
| `team.max_wall_clock_minutes` | positive int | `120` |
| `dag` | object | unset |

`task.dag` is an optional block bounding the DAG orchestration subsystem (`schema/task.ts`): `max_nodes_per_run` (`64`), `max_runs_per_session` (`16`), `subscriber_ring` (`1000`), `heartbeat_ms` (`15000`), `history_default_limit` (`256`), `history_max_limit` (`1000`), `retention_days` (`7`), `max_prompt_bytes` (`262144`).

`global_concurrency` caps how many tasks run at once per senpi process, across all model and provider lanes combined. It applies only to the senpi engine; OpenCode `background_task` is unaffected (parity is a follow-up). The cap is per process, not cross-process or machine-wide: two senpi processes each get their own budget. A task spills to a later entry in its fallback chain whenever admission cannot seat it in the preferred model's lane — the per-model/provider/default lane limit is reached or its queue is occupied (the common case), or this global cap is full — even though the preferred model never failed. That later entry can be a DIFFERENT provider, with different pricing and different data handling. If that matters to you, remove cross-provider entries from your fallback chains or use single-model chains. No new storage or telemetry is introduced by this setting.

`state_dir` defaults to `<agent dir>/projects/<folder>-<path hash>/senpi-task` when unset, so task state never lands in the project's `git status`; a project that already has a `.omo/senpi-task` directory from an earlier release keeps using it (`packages/senpi-task/src/store/project-state-directory.ts`). Completion delivery is not configurable: every child completion is batched with any other ready notifications and steered into the parent's running turn at the next tool-call boundary; see the completion routing table in [`packages/senpi-task/AGENTS.md`](../../packages/senpi-task/AGENTS.md).

### `teams`

A record of team name to spec (`schema/team.ts`). Each spec:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `version` | literal `1` | default `1` |
| `name` | string matching `^[a-z0-9-]+$` | optional |
| `description` | string | |
| `createdAt` | positive int | epoch ms |
| `leadAgentId` | string | required when `members` has more than one entry |
| `teamAllowedPaths` | string[] | |
| `sessionPermission` | string | |
| `members` | 1..8 members | discriminated on `kind` |

Each member shares a base (`name` matching `^[a-z0-9-]+$`, optional `cwd`, `worktreePath`, `subscriptions`, `color`, `isActive` default `true`, `backendType` default `in-process`) and one of two `kind`s:

- `kind: "category"` requires `category` and `prompt`.
- `kind: "subagent_type"` requires `subagent_type`; `prompt` is optional.

### `profiles`

A record of profile name to a partial view (`schema/config.ts` `OmoConfigProfileSchema`). Each profile accepts the shared base keys (`categories`, `agents`, `task`, `teams`, `models`, `model_profiles`, `model_profile`, `memory`, `telemetry`) plus `[opencode]`, `[native]`, and `[codex]` blocks of its own:

```jsonc
{
  "profiles": {
    "kimi": {
      "categories": {
        "deep-low": { "model": "kimi-for-coding/kimi-k3" }
      },
      "[native]": {
        "agents": {
          "plan-reviewer": { "model": "kimi-for-coding/kimi-k3" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Profiles are inert until activated (see [Profile activation](#profile-activation)). When active, the profile's base keys fold over the shared base, and the profile's harness block folds over the top-level harness block. A config profile is a different thing from a model profile: see [Model profiles](#model-profiles-native-harness).

### Model references and model strings

`model` accepts either a catalog alias or a provider-prefixed string. Reasoning levels can be written inline with a `:level` suffix, for example `openai/gpt-6-astra:xhigh`. The suffix is canonical; the older `model(xhigh)` and `model xhigh` forms remain accepted during the back-compat window and are normalized by migration.

`models` is the shared ordered chain shape used by categories, agents, and harness blocks. Each entry may be a string or a model object. Object entries use the canonical fields documented above, including `reasoning` and `provider_options`.

Deprecated chain keys are still accepted for now, but they map to `models` and the canonical `reasoning` field:

| Old key | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| `fallback_models` | `models` |
| `variant` | `reasoning` |
| `reasoningEffort` | `reasoning` |
| `thinking` | `reasoning` + `provider_options` |
| `textVerbosity` | `provider_options.textVerbosity` |
| `maxTokens` | `max_tokens` |

The migration engine rewrites the persisted config in place, and doctor reports any leftover deprecated keys with their exact file and key path.

## Example

```jsonc
// .omo/omo.jsonc
{
  "task": {
    "default_execution_mode": "auto",
    "default_concurrency": 4,
    "wait": { "default_ms": 90000 }
  },
  "categories": {
    "deep-low": {
      "models": [
        { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5-5", "reasoning": "high" },
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
      ]
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "researcher": {
      "description": "Read-only investigator",
      "execution_mode": "process",
      "tools": { "task": false }
    }
  },
  "teams": {
    "reviewers": {
      "leadAgentId": "lead",
      "members": [
        { "kind": "category", "name": "quick", "category": "deep-low", "prompt": "Review the diff." }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration from legacy files

Before the unification, the OpenCode plugin read a walked `oh-my-openagent.json[c]` / `oh-my-opencode.json[c]` chain and the Codex/Senpi harnesses read `~/.omo/config.jsonc`. Those files are history: a lock-and-journal migration engine imports them into `omo.jsonc` once, and nothing reads them at runtime afterward.

- The legacy OpenCode user file imports into `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` under `[opencode]`; each legacy `profiles/<name>/` directory becomes `profiles.<name>."[opencode]"` holding only the keys that differ from the user file; project `.opencode/` files import into that project's `.omo/omo.jsonc`.
- `~/.omo/config.jsonc` imports its `[opencode]` / `[codex]` blocks; a legacy `[omo]` block maps to `[native]`.
- No-clobber: a value already present in the target wins, and skipped legacy values surface as diagnostics. Legacy migration history is preserved under `legacy_migrations`, and applied migrations are marked in the target's `_migrations` array (`2026-07-opencode-config-unification` for the `oh-my-*` files, `2026-07-codex-config-jsonc` for `~/.omo/config.jsonc`, and `2026-08-reasoning-unification` for persisted model and reasoning fields).
- Sources move to `~/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC timestamp>-opencode-config/` (project sources to `<project>/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC timestamp>/`).
- Triggers: OpenCode plugin startup, Senpi startup, and install run both migration groups; Codex startup runs only the `config.jsonc` group; `oh-my-openagent config migrate` runs both on demand (`--dry-run`, `--json`).

Full user-facing detail: [`docs/reference/configuration.md`](./configuration.md#migration).

## Mixed-version compatibility

The unified file is read starting with oh-my-openagent 5.0.0 (current `5.0.0-beta.13`): the OpenCode plugin, the Senpi adapter, and the Codex plugin at 5.0.0 or later all load `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` plus walked project `.omo/omo.jsonc` and nothing else. Harnesses from 4.x still read the legacy files, which the migration has moved into the backup directory.

One sharp edge when mixing versions: every schema object is `.strict()`. A pre-unification copy of `@oh-my-opencode/omo-config-core` rejects an `omo.jsonc` that contains keys it does not know, which includes `models`, `profiles`, and the `[opencode]` / `[native]` / `[codex]` harness blocks. An older strict core handed a newer unified file fails validation on those keys instead of ignoring them.

To downgrade:

1. Quit every running harness so no migration or config write is in flight.
2. Restore the legacy files from the newest `~/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC timestamp>-opencode-config/` directory (and `<project>/.omo/migration-backup-<UTC timestamp>/` for project files): each backup holds the legacy sources at their original relative paths, so copy them back to where the backup tree mirrors them.
3. Remove or rename `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` if the older harness must not see it, then install the older version.

To re-upgrade later, delete the restored legacy files or let the migration re-import them; existing values in `omo.jsonc` still win under the no-clobber policy.

## Follow-ups

- `member.backendType: "tmux"` and non-project (user-global) team storage are schema-level only and are not exercised by the current Senpi runtime; use `in-process` members in project `.omo/` teams.
