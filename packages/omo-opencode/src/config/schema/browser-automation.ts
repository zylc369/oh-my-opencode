   * a system-wide Chrome install (typically `/opt/google/chrome/chrome` on
   * Linux). In sandboxed environments (containers, dev containers, CI runners,
   * remote coding sandboxes) that binary is often absent, and Playwright's

   *
   * Common overrides:
   * - `["--headless", "--no-sandbox", "--executable-path", "/path/to/chromium"]`
   *   to point at Playwright's bundled Chromium in a sandboxed container.
   *
   * This option is honored only from user config. Walked project config cannot
   * set raw Playwright process arguments.
