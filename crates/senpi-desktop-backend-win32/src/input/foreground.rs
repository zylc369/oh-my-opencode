//! The focus guard: foreground delivery gives the target the foreground
//! (`SetForegroundWindow`), confirms Win32 made it foreground, acts through
//! `SendInput`, waits until that input was delivered to the target
//! ([`barrier::delivered`]), and only then hands the foreground back to the
//! window that had it. oh-my-pi (`win32/input.rs:577-626`) restores without
//! that wait and races the raw input thread. Win32 grants the foreground only to
//! the process that received the last input event, so a refused request is
//! retried once after a zero-motion `SendInput` makes this process that
//! source. There is no `AttachThreadInput` fallback: a request still refused
//! is an error, never input sent to whichever window happens to be in front.
