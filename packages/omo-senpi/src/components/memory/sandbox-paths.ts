/**
 * Canonicalizes as much of the path as exists and re-joins the remaining segments.
 *
 * The sandbox is built BEFORE the reflection child runs, and several granted entries
 * (runtime/reflection, runtime/reflection-sessions, the resolved agent dir, XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
 * legitimately do not exist yet on a fresh machine or a first reflection. A bare realpathSync
 * throws `ENOENT ... lstat '<first missing ancestor>'` there, which surfaced as a pre-spawn
 * `spawn_failed` and stalled the reflection cursor.
 *
 * Only the existing prefix is resolved through the filesystem; the absent tail is appended
 * verbatim, so the grant always names the full intended path and can never widen to an ancestor.
