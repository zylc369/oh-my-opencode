/**
 * Tool-search discovery metadata for the thread tool family.
 *
 * The BM25 tokenizer splits camelCase and every non-alphanumeric run before
 * lowercasing, so the shared `thread` prefix carries no discriminating power:
 * ranking is decided by the verb token and the keywords. Field weights in the
 * shipped engine are name/label/alias/keyword 3, group 2, description and
 * searchText 1, which is why every label leads with its verb and the
 * user-worded phrases live in keywords. No keyword string repeats across the
 * nine tools and no indexed field carries a negated-use sentence, because the
 * engine indexes negated words positively.
