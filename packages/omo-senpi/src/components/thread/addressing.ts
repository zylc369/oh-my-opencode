/**
 * Addressing and scope resolution for the thread tool family.
 *
 * Every entry point returns its outcome as data: the error branch is a
 * discriminated `{ kind: "error", ... }` object carrying a taxonomy code and
 * a `next_action` that names thread_list, so a runner hands the failure
 * straight to the model instead of catching (authoring rules R6/R7).
 *
 * Resolution ladder (spec order):
 *   1. An exact durable-id match wins immediately. Scoped callers only see
 *      the hit when it shares their workspace; a hit outside the default
 *      scope is `scope_denied` and never degrades to `not_found`, even when a
 *      same-named thread is visible, because the id already names one thread.
 *   2. Otherwise the target is matched against NFKC-normalized names over the
 *      visible entries: one match resolves as a name, two or more are
 *      `ambiguous_target` with candidates, zero is `not_found`.
 *
 * Workspace scope: two paths share one workspace when they sit inside the
 * same git work tree (canonical `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` equality;
 * linked work trees of one repository count as separate workspaces), and
 * when neither side is in git, when their realpath'd directories are equal.
 * `all_scope: true` widens visibility to every entry the daemon knows.
