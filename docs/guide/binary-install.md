# Installing the compiled `omo` binary

Each GitHub Release of oh-my-openagent attaches per-OS/arch single-file `omo` executables plus a `SHA256SUMS` checksum file. The binary is self-contained: it embeds the senpi engine, the omo plugin payload, and every runtime resource, and provisions them into `~/.omo/binary-runtime/<version>/` on first run. No node, npm, or bun install is required.

## Install (per OS)

Download the asset for your platform with `curl`, make it executable, and run it. Replace `<VERSION>` with the release tag (for example `5.0.0-beta.20`) and `<TARGET>` with your platform from the table below.

```sh
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -Lo omo "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/omo-darwin-arm64"
chmod +x omo
./omo --version
```

```sh
# macOS (Intel)
curl -Lo omo "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/omo-darwin-x64"
chmod +x omo
./omo --version
```

```sh
# Linux x64 (glibc)
curl -Lo omo "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/omo-linux-x64"
chmod +x omo
./omo --version
```

```sh
# Linux ARM64 (glibc)
curl -Lo omo "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/omo-linux-arm64"
chmod +x omo
./omo --version
```

```sh
# Linux x64 (musl / Alpine)
curl -Lo omo "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/omo-linux-x64-musl"
chmod +x omo
./omo --version
```

```powershell
# Windows x64 (PowerShell)
curl.exe -Lo omo.exe "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/omo-windows-x64.exe"
.\omo.exe --version
```

Verify the download against the release checksums:

```sh
curl -LO "https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/releases/download/v<VERSION>/SHA256SUMS"
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

## macOS: use curl, not a browser download

The binaries are unsigned. A binary downloaded through a web browser carries the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute and macOS Gatekeeper will suspend it on first run. `curl` does not attach that attribute, so installing with the `curl` commands above avoids the quarantine prompt entirely. Do not strip quarantine attributes with `xattr -d` as a workaround - that weakens the same protection on files that genuinely need it.

## First run: self-provisioning

On first run the binary writes its runtime to `~/.omo/binary-runtime/<version>/` (the engine, plugin, native PTY prebuild, themes, and assets) and re-executes from there. Subsequent runs start directly from the provisioned copy. This is normal and happens once per version.

## Updating

There is no in-place updater. Reinstall: download the new release's asset the same way and replace the binary. The `update` subcommand prints the exact `curl` command for your platform.

## Notes and limits

- **Windows ARM64 is a true ARM64 binary.** This differs from the npm `oh-my-opencode-windows-arm64` package, which ships an x64 binary under emulation. The release asset runs natively on ARM64 Windows.
- **`--inspect` / inspector mode is unsupported** in the compiled binaries; use the npm install for debugging with an inspector.
- **Beta and stable releases both carry these assets.** The compiled binary is the OmO Native edition; on stable releases it is still built from the beta-channel engine, so treat it as a beta-quality native build attached for convenience.
- **glibc floor:** the Linux glibc binaries inherit Bun's own glibc floor; older distributions should use the musl (Alpine) variants.
