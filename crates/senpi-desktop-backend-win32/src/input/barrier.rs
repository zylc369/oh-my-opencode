//! The delivery barrier of foreground input. `SendInput` only appends to
//! the raw input thread's (RIT) queue; the RIT routes each event to the
//! thread that owns the foreground when it gets to it, and that thread takes
//! it off its own queue later. Handing the foreground back straight after
//! `SendInput` therefore sends the tail of the input to the previous window
//! or nowhere. [`delivered`] waits for both hops on signals Win32 produces,
//! each bounded by a hang guard:
//!
//! 1. Routed: a sentinel press of an unassigned key goes in after the input.
//!    The RIT updates the async key state as it routes each event, in queue
//!    order, so once `GetAsyncKeyState` reports the sentinel down every
//!    earlier event reached the target's thread. Its release is awaited the
//!    same way, so no transition of it is left for the previous window.
//! 2. Consumed: a one-pixel invalidation of the target thread's focus
//!    window. Win32 generates `WM_PAINT` only when the thread's sent, posted
//!    and input queues are empty, so once `GetUpdateRect` reports the window
//!    clean the thread has taken - and dispatched - every routed event and
//!    the messages they posted (`WM_CHAR`).
//!
//! No hook and no `AttachThreadInput`: the barrier only observes.
