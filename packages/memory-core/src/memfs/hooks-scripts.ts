/**
 * Git hook scripts installed into memory repositories, kept as data so the

 *
 * Ported from letta-code src/agent/memory-git-hooks.ts. Two deliberate
 * deviations: the scripts are POSIX sh (letta used bash-only constructs such
 * as herestrings, `echo -e` and `$'\t'`, which break under dash on Linux), and
 * the mirror remote is read from the `omo.*` git config namespace.

/**
 * Pre-commit validator for staged memory markdown.
 *
 * Rules (letta parity plus the strict-YAML contract shared with the skill loader):
 * - Scope is `.md` under `system/`, `reference/` or `people/`, plus
 *   `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with an optional legacy `memory/` prefix. Root
 *   markdown is intentionally NOT validated.
 * - Frontmatter is required, must open and close with `---`.
 * - `description` is required and must be a non-empty single line.
 * - Every value must be a quoted scalar or a plain scalar that strict YAML
 *   reads verbatim: no `: `, no ` #`, no trailing `:`, no leading indicator.
 * - Known keys are `description`, `read_only`, the legacy `limit`, and the
 *   people-record keys `kind` and `aliases`; any other key fails the commit.
 *   SKILL.md may carry any additional key (`name`, `version`, `deprecated`).
 * - `read_only` is protected: it cannot be added, changed or removed by the
 *   agent, and a file that is `read_only: true` in HEAD cannot be modified.
 * - Skills must be folders: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Flat `skills/<name>.md`
 *   is rejected.
