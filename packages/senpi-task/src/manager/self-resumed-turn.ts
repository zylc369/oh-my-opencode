 * A child whose turn already settled can start a run on its own - its monitor fired, its background
 * job finished (omo#9069). That run is work the parent has not seen, so the record goes back to
 * `running` under the next run_epoch (marked `resumed_run_epoch`) and outcome tracking is re-armed
 * exactly as a task_send revival does: the run's end becomes a second completion, announced as a
 * resumed turn's result. The earlier completion stays delivered. The settled outcome is persisted
 * first, so the reopen waits for it; a child that was cancelled, suspended or replaced meanwhile is
 * left alone.
