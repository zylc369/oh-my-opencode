  return `Spawn one child task or fan out a batch.

Choose exactly one input form:
- Single: prompt
- Batch: tasks (1-16 items); top-level target, model, and skills are inherited when an item omits them. An inherited model is rejected when the item's effective target is a category.

Each spawn MUST provide EITHER category OR subagent_type after inheritance. DO NOT provide both.

- category routes to the category worker. Available categories:
${renderCategoryList(categories)}
- subagent_type invokes a loaded agent directly. Available agents: ${agentNames}${gatedLine}${planReviewerNotice}
  A subagent_type that names no loaded agent fails with unknown_target; a category name belongs in category, never in subagent_type.

Blank provider padding is normalized automatically; do not add filler values.
load_skills prepends named skills. run_in_background=true returns the task id at once and the child's result arrives later as a message; false blocks this turn until the child finishes.
run_in_background is batch-wide: set it once at the top level. An item-level copy must agree with the top-level value and every other item, or the call fails with invalid_arguments.
name is an optional stable handle. model is an explicit override for subagent_type spawns ONLY.
isolated runs a child in a checkout clone; it defaults to task.isolation.enabled. apply controls merge-back; false retains artifacts only. merge selects patch or branch. Batch items inherit these three options unless overridden. apply and merge require isolation to be enabled.
NEVER combine model with category: a category-routed task always takes its model from omo.json (categories.<name>.models), so passing both fails with invalid_arguments.
task_send continues an existing child; task always spawns.
Prompts MUST be in English.`
