const reviewWorkCodexGate = `
On Codex, use \`review-work\` only when the user asks for a review or demands
strict, rigorous, or high-accuracy verification, not automatically for a PR or
completion claim. Your own manual QA and the main session's self-review are
the default. Spawn ONE \`lazycodex-gate-reviewer\` only for an explicit demand
for strict review; otherwise run the review checklist inline and record the
main session's verdict instead of spawning or waiting for a reviewer. These
Codex rules override the mandatory-reviewer instructions in the shared skill.

When \`review-work\` is used as a final implementation, PR, or \`$ulw-execute\`
gate, the selected review is blocking. A timeout, missing deliverable, ack-only response,
explicit \`BLOCKED:\`, or inconclusive lane is not a pass. Treat that lane as
failed, investigate the underlying uncertainty with the \`debugging\` skill when
runtime behavior may be wrong, fix with evidence, and rerun the affected lane
before claiming completion, creating or handing off a PR, or merging.

After each lane reaches PASS, immediately append a durable task-evidence record
to the active ledger with the lane name, exact full commit SHA, PASS verdict,
and report artifact/source. Before reusing coverage after continuation or
compaction, re-read that record and require the exact lane/SHA pair. Memory,
chat history, or an unstamped report is not coverage; a new commit requires
fresh applicable lane records.

A rejecting lane must name its blockers inline in its final message — each
blocker cites the violated goal criterion or requirement plus an evidence
pointer. A bare REJECT/FAIL token without findings is not a verdict; treat it
as an inconclusive lane (one bounded respawn, then record it inconclusive with
that reason).

When reviewing a PR or branch, collect diff, file contents, and verification
results from a dedicated review worktree attached to that branch. Never
checkout, test, or edit the review branch in the main worktree.

Review evidence must be safe to share. Redact or mask secrets and sensitive
user data before including evidence in logs, PR bodies, or handoffs. Never
include raw tokens, credentials, auth headers, cookies, API keys, env dumps,
private logs, or PII; summarize with lengths, hashes, and short non-sensitive
prefixes when identity is needed.
