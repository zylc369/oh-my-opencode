// Ordered terminal writes for a facts run.
//
// THE ORDERING IS THE CONTRACT: the failure record lands BEFORE the terminal sentinel
// (final.json / abandoned.json). A crash in that window is safe - reconciliation replays the
// same run with the same failureId and `applyFailure` is idempotent per failureId, so the
// streak cannot double-increment. The reverse order would lose the increment entirely: the
// sentinel makes the run terminal, reconciliation skips it, and the batch relaunches forever
// with no backoff - the incident shape this module exists to prevent.
//
// THE FAILURE IDENTITY IS THE LEDGER'S `batchId`, NEVER THE RUN NAME. Retention can free
// `facts-<digest>-<attempt>` and hand the same name to a later launch (see `nextAttempt`), so a
// run-name failureId would make a genuine new failure look like a crash replay of the pruned one:
// `applyFailure` would skip it, the streak would stay pinned and the batch would never park.
// `batchId` is minted fresh per launch and written into ledger.json, so replays (which read the
// same ledger) stay idempotent while distinct launches can never collide.
