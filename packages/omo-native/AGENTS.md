# packages/omo-native

**Role:** Adapter - distribution package for the senpi-based omo native edition.

Publishes npm package `omo-ai` (bin `omo`) on the channel its version names: a prerelease on `beta`, a stable release on `latest`. The launcher in `bin/` runs the
exact-pinned `@code-yeongyu/senpi` CLI with `--extension <pkgRoot>/plugin`, where `plugin/` is the staged
omo-senpi plugin payload produced by `bun run build:omo-native` (gitignored, never committed).

- `bin/omo.js` - launcher entry (dispatch, doctor, setup, senpi passthrough)
- brand: the launcher injects a `SENPI_BRAND` profile (name, `~/.omo/agent` home, `OMO_*` env prefix, wire identity, omo-ai update channel of the running version) so the pinned engine presents as omo; `--version` and every self-update spelling are answered by the launcher. See `docs/reference/omo-ai-publishing.md`.
- `bin/lib/` - launcher modules:
  - `launcher.js` — `runLauncher()` dispatch, senpi environment/brand/update routing
  - `agent-dir.js` — `canonicalAgentDir()`, `adoptLegacyFlatState()`, legacy flat-dir migration
  - `setup-detect.js` / `setup-import.js` / `setup-models.js` / `setup-report.js` — harness detection, SQLite read-only import, provider mapping, report rendering
  - `setup-detect-cache.js` / `setup-detect-refresh.js` — the interactive launch's setup-suggestion cache: a
    synchronous, fail-open read of `harness-detect-cache.json` in the canonical agent dir, fingerprinted over
    every detection input (`detectedFilePaths`, mtime+size) with a TTL; a stale or missing cache never blocks
    the engine spawn - it is rebuilt by a detached, unref'd refresh child (`setup-detect-refresh.js`, the only
    writer) while the launch answers from the cached or empty value. `omo setup` and `omo doctor` always run
    full live detection and never read the cache.
  - `bun-runtime.js` / `child-process.js` — `maybeReexecUnderBun`, `findBunBinary`, `probeBunVersion`,
    `spawnNode`/`runChild`. Runtime policy: a machine with bun runs omo on bun, no config needed - a
    bun-global install trusts the bun that installed it, every other install (npm, project-local,
    bunx) probes the discovered bun once per node boot and hands over when it is >= `BUN_MIN_VERSION`
    (1.4.0); `OMO_RUNTIME=node` always stays on node, `OMO_RUNTIME=bun` always re-execs (no floor).
    POSIX handoffs use `execve` with argv[0], preserving the PID, args and environment without a
    resident wrapper. Windows, missing execve and thrown execve retain async `runChild`; daemon
    attach also stays spawn-based. The fallback forwards `SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP`, waits up to
    `OMO_SIGNAL_GRACE_MS` (default 10s), then re-raises an ignored signal. It waits for `SIGINT`
    without forwarding it twice. Never use `spawnSync` for these long-lived handoffs.
  - `bun-bin-shim.js` — `ensureBunBinShim`: keeps the user-facing bun-global bin an sh shim that
    execs bun directly (POSIX only, self-healing across `bun add -g` updates, fail-open)
  - `doctor.js` — diagnostics plus stale-orphan detection: `classifyEngineProcesses` splits live
    engines into stale (interactive, PPID 1), attached and managed (`--mode`), and
    `reapStaleEngines` terminates ONLY explicitly named pids that are still stale at request time.
    Pattern-killing is forbidden.
  - `engine-prepare.js` / `claude-code-floor.js` - the installed-engine preparation (Claude Code UA floor, compile-safe css-tree data, RPC stream guard). postinstall (`bin/senpi-patch.mjs`) runs it and stamps the engine tree with `.omo-engine-prepared` (the omo-ai package version); the launcher runs `ensureEnginePrepared` before every engine start so an install whose scripts never ran (`ignore-scripts=true`, Bun's blocked postinstalls) is prepared on first launch (#8713). A failure warns with the reinstall command and never blocks the launch.
  - `launch-spec-mode.js` - `normalizeLaunchSpecMode` strips group/world write bits from `plugin/daemon-launch-spec.json` (regular file owned by this user only, `lstat`, never through a symlink; no-op on win32) because npm/bun extraction applies the installer's umask and the task host refuses a writable spec (#9208). `engine-prepare.js` `preparePluginLaunchSpec` runs it fail-open on every launch (`preparedSenpi()`, before `omo doctor`) and in postinstall; `launchSpecDoctorLines` gives `omo doctor` (npm and compiled) a FAIL line with the fix when the host would still refuse the spec.
  - `rpc-stream-errors.js` - postinstall/launch preparation of the installed engine's stdio RPC serializer. A malformed streamed event produces a failed `prompt` response with `errorCode: invalid_stream_event` and shuts down with exit 1. The same preparation runs after an omob engine swap; repeated preparation is idempotent, and a missing RPC target, missing required binding (including `shutdown`), or unsupported serializer shape fails installation rather than silently missing the guard. Binding checks also run on already-prepared code.
  - `category-coverage.js` - the task-category coverage lines of doctor and the setup summary: the pinned engine's
    offline ModelRuntime (read-only auth.json, models.json, env keys; nothing written) classified by the senpi-task
    resolver through `plugin/runtime/category-coverage/index.js`, which `build:omo-native` bundles from
    `category-coverage-entry.ts`. Fail-open: any error prints no line and omits the row.
  - `package-paths.js`, `provider-map.json`, `legacy-bun-global-migration.js`
- **agent state lives in ONE canonical directory: `~/.omo/agent`.** `bin/lib/agent-dir.js` owns that answer (`canonicalAgentDir`), and the launcher, `omo doctor`, `omo setup` and the locally installed launcher (`packages/omo-senpi/src/install/local-launcher.ts`) all resolve it from there - never by composing their own default. An explicit `OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (or legacy `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` / `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) still wins, and `adoptLegacyFlatState` carries state left in the pre-unification flat `~/.omo` layout forward once, so unifying the location never reads as another reset.
- `bin/omo-agent-toolkit.js` - internal delegate to the staged toolkit runtime, NOT an npm bin
- `test/` - package-contract and launcher tests; `pty-signal-qa.py` is the real-surface QA harness
  (boots the real chain on a pty whose session leader outlives the launcher, SIGTERMs the launcher,
  asserts the engine ran its own graceful shutdown and left no survivor)

## CONVENTIONS

- ESM (`"type": "module"`); local JS imports use explicit `.js` extensions; Node built-ins via `node:` prefix.
- Runtime requires Node >= 24; tests run under Bun.
- Paths derive from `import.meta.url` + the agent-dir helpers — never recompose home-directory defaults elsewhere.
- Setup is plan/classify/consent/write oriented; SQLite stores are read-only inputs.

## COMMANDS

```bash
bun run build:omo-native                 # stage plugin payload (repo root)
bun test packages/omo-native/test        # package tests (repo root)
bunx tsc -p packages/omo-native/tsconfig.json --noEmit
node packages/omo-native/bin/omo.js --version   # entry smoke check
python3 packages/omo-native/test/pty-signal-qa.py packages/omo-native/bin/omo.js /tmp/qa.txt   # launcher signal QA (bun chain wherever bun is installed; OMO_RUNTIME=node for the node chain)
```

## omo daemon

`bin/lib/daemon.js`: `omo daemon run|attach|status|stop [--drain] [--all [--wait [--timeout <s>]]]|handoff|gc [--prune-store-index]|rollback-prepare`, a thin wrapper over the engine's `senpi host`. `run`/`attach` map to the engine's `ensure` of the operator daemon on `rpc.sock`; `status`, `gc`, `handoff`, `stop --all` and `rollback-prepare` cover every endpoint (the operator daemon, each session's `p-*` task host, each Desktop `i-*` thread host) through `daemon-operations.js`, `daemon-status.js` and `daemon-rollback.js`. `--foreground` on any subcommand exits 2 before the engine is called (after the unknown-subcommand check and the win32 refusal, which exits 4), because the engine host always detaches; `--persistent` is accepted and ignored. Exit codes 2/3/4/5 live in `daemon-args.js` with the flag sets and argv helpers; the `omo doctor` lines come from `daemon-doctor-report.js`. The compiled entry re-runs ITSELF with `host ...` to reach the engine (process.execPath is omo there). Reference: `docs/reference/omo-daemon.md`.
