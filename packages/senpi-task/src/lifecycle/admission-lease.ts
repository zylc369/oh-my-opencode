/**
 * Crash-safe per-parent-session admission lease (`<stateDir>/locks/session-<parentSessionId>.lock`).
 *
 * Why not `withTaskRecordLock` for the batch itself: that primitive is a mutex for sub-10ms record
 * writes. It is taken from a holder only once the holder is proven dead (store/lock-owner.ts), and a
 * waiter gives up after one holder keeps it for 1s - blocking its thread meanwhile in the sync
 * variant. A batch admission section is longer-lived, so waiters behind it would time out, and a
 * holder that is alive but no longer renewing could never be taken over. This
 * lease is a RENEWABLE OWNER-TOKEN lease instead: the body is `{pid, token, renewed_at}`, the
 * holder refreshes `renewed_at` on a timer, and `token` (minted fresh per acquisition) is the
 * fencing token. Takeover is a compare-and-swap that re-validates BOTH the observed token and the
 * staleness under a short mutex, so a holder that renewed between a waiter's observation and its
 * CAS is never displaced. The mutex (`withTaskRecordLock`) only ever guards sub-10ms
 * read-check-rename sections - exactly what it was built for.
