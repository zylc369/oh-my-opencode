# ATTRIBUTION / NOTICE

This skill (`ultimate-browsing`, part of `@oh-my-opencode/shared-skills`) ships
project-original content plus two third-party tools that it installs at runtime
(it does NOT vendor their source). Each runtime tool's license and required
notices are reproduced below.

---

## 1. Project-original content (no third-party source vendored)

The following are authored by the oh-my-openagent project and carry no third-party
license obligation:

- `engine/**` — the insane-search Tier-1 fetch engine (curl_cffi grid, WAF
  detection, Playwright fallback templates, `bias_check.py` no-site-name gate).
- `references/insane-search/**` and `references/agent-reach/**` — the Tier-1 and
  Tier-1.5 reference docs.
- `scripts/extract_cookies.py`, `scripts/cookie_paths.py`, `scripts/cookie_crypto.py`
  and their tests — the cross-platform cookie module.
- `SKILL.md`, `references/chrome-stealth.md`.

These reference platform-native CLIs and public APIs by name (e.g. `xhs`, `yt-dlp`,
`agent-reach`, `mcporter`, Jina Reader, V2EX public API). Those are external tools the
user installs separately; this skill includes none of their source.

## 2. CloakBrowser (CloakHQ) — Tier-2 stealth Chromium (runtime dependency)

The Tier-2 stealth browser is **CloakBrowser**, installed at runtime via `pip`
(`pip install cloakbrowser`). No CloakBrowser source is vendored in this repository.

- Source: https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser
- Pinned runtime version: **0.4.0** (documented in `references/chrome-stealth.md`;
  this is a documented version string, not an automated drift check).
- Wrapper source license: MIT License.
- Binary license: the compiled CloakBrowser Chromium binary downloaded by
  `cloakbrowser.ensure_binary()` is governed by the separate CloakBrowser
  Binary License:
  https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser/blob/main/BINARY-LICENSE.md
- Redistribution note: this npm package does not redistribute the CloakBrowser
  binary, does not repackage it, and does not include it in `skills/` or
  `dist/skills`. Users who run the Tier-2 setup download the binary directly
  from CloakHQ's official distribution channels and must comply with that
  binary license.

MIT wrapper source license:

## 3. agent-browser (vercel-labs) — Tier-2 CDP automation CLI (runtime dependency)

The Tier-2 automation CLI is **agent-browser**, installed at runtime via `npm`
(`npm i -g agent-browser`). No agent-browser source is vendored in this repository.

- Source: https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser
- Pinned runtime version: **0.29.1** (documented in `references/chrome-stealth.md`;
  documented version string, no automated drift check).
- Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use
  these files except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the

- **Changes (Apache-2.0 §4(b)):** none. agent-browser is installed unmodified at
  runtime; no agent-browser source file is copied, modified, or redistributed by this
  skill. This skill only documents how to invoke the upstream CLI.

- **NOTICE:** the upstream agent-browser distribution may include a `NOTICE` file. As
  this skill redistributes no agent-browser source, no upstream NOTICE content is
  bundled here; consult the upstream repository for its `NOTICE` file when present.

- **Trademark notice:** "agent-browser" and "Vercel" are referenced by name for
  identification only. No trademark license is granted under the Apache License 2.0
  (Section 6).
