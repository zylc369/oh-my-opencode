# Third Party Notices

This file enumerates third-party components redistributed by the root `oh-my-opencode` package surface from `package.json` `files[]`, root production dependencies, and bundled MCP/runtime payloads.

Generator/checker note: update this file with the audited component list, then run `node scripts/check-third-party-notices.mjs`. Task 11 owns tarball ship verification.

## Downloaded binaries

### comment-checker v0.8.0
- License: MIT, as declared by the upstream project.
- Copyright: Yeongyu Kim and contributors.
- Upstream URL: https://github.com/code-yeongyu/go-claude-code-comment-checker/releases
- Distribution: the OpenCode hook downloads the host-platform release binary into its local cache on first use. The root package no longer installs the npm package or its all-platform `vendor/` payload. Separate Codex component notices remain in `packages/omo-codex/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.
