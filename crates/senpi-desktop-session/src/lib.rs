//! The desktop session: one `senpi-desktop-session` thread owns the backend,
//! the AX ref registry, and the capture frame cache, and serves requests in
//! submission order. Each request runs under `catch_unwind` and its waiter
//! gives up at the injected [`SessionTimeouts`] deadline. Every mutating
//! request passes one choke point (`mutate`): the safety gate, a focus/cursor
//! transaction, and one audit event to [`SessionSafety::audit`].
