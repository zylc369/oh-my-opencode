# memory-core - Harness-Neutral Agent Memory Engine

## OVERVIEW

`@oh-my-opencode/memory-core` owns the shared memory domain used by harness
adapters: a git-backed markdown MemFS, atomic memory tools, prompt compilation,
reflection scheduling, transcript search, synchronization, and seed content.
The public API is the barrel at `src/index.ts`.

## ANATOMY

| Directory | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `src/git/` | Git command boundary, clean-tree checks, commits, merges, remotes, and typed git errors. |
| `src/identity/` | Memory identity resolution and the `OMO_MEMORY_HOME` directory layout. |
| `src/locks/` | Cross-process locks for memory writes, reflection scheduling, and transcript state, plus the machine-wide `recall-wake` counting lease (`recall-wake.slot-<n>.lock` per slot, FIFO `recall-wake.tickets/`, default 2 slots, proof-based stale recovery for slots and tickets alike, bounded wait ending in `RecallWakeBusyError`). |
| `src/memfs/` | Memory-path validation, markdown frontmatter parsing, and hook-script installation. |
| `src/tools/` | `memory` and `memory_apply_patch` operations, patch parsing, typed tool errors, and auto-commit behavior. `leaked-arguments.ts` splits an argument that leaked into its sibling (`summary</description>\n<parameter name="file_text">body`) back apart before `runMemoryTool` validates. |
| `src/journal/` | Per-conversation transcript cursors, reflection snapshots, and durable journal state. |
| `src/facts/` | Durable fact pipeline: queue + cursor watermarks, failure backoff/store, payload capping, person routing, recovery, mutation planning. |
| `src/people/` | People-card grammar: parse/serialize, slug rules, reserved slugs, observations. |
| `src/soul/` | Soul-file paths and identity-scoped soul-notice watermark consumption. |
| `src/reflection/` | Trigger evaluation, run reservation, worktree execution, completion validation, merge outcomes, the orphan sweep that reclaims worktrees/branches no live run owns, and the park policy that stops automatic reflection after repeated failures (one half-open probe per interval). |
| `src/compile/` | Compile committed memory revisions into marked system-prompt blocks and cache them by template hash. |
| `src/search/` | Query parsing, transcript providers, and ranked memory/session search. |
| `src/sync/` | Remote mirror synchronization and secret redaction. |
| `src/reminders/` | Reflection and memory-maintenance reminder generation. |
| `src/seeds/` | Default memory blocks and first-run repository seeding. |
| `src/concurrency/` | Subprocess fixtures for lock and multi-writer tests; not a public runtime module. |

## CORE INVARIANTS

- **Stay harness-neutral.** Production code and package dependencies must not
  import Senpi, Pi, OpenCode adapters, or other harness-specific packages.
  `src/harness-neutrality.test.ts` enforces this boundary.
- **Treat the memory repository as transactional state.** Write tools acquire
  the `memory-write` lock, require a clean repository, validate paths, apply one
  operation, and commit only the affected paths. Do not bypass
  `GitMemoryRepo`, lock domains, or the tool entry points.
- **Compile from committed state.** Prompt compilation may target `HEAD` or an
  explicit revision. Uncommitted working-tree content is not authoritative
  memory.
- **Preserve markdown contracts.** Memory files require YAML frontmatter with a
  non-empty `description`; `read_only: "true"` blocks mutation. Keep UTF-8,
  normalized repository-relative paths, and LF output.
- **Frontmatter is strict YAML, one grammar everywhere.** `renderMemoryFile`
  is the only writer: it quotes any scalar that the `yaml` package would not
  read back verbatim and re-parses its own header. The reader decodes quoted
  scalars, keeps non-contract keys (`extra`) so SKILL.md `name`/`version`
  survive edits, and only falls back to the legacy first-colon grammar for
  pre-existing files. `describeFrontmatterViolation` is the shared gate for
  the pre-commit hook rules, `validateCompletion`, and
  `normalizeMemoryFrontmatter` (one-time legacy repair keyed by a marker in
  the common git dir). Never emit an unquoted `description:` by hand.
- **Keep reflection transitions deterministic.** Manual triggers outrank
  compaction, which outranks step-count triggers. Only one active run and one
  merged pending reservation may exist.
- **Keep locks domain-specific.** Use `memory-write`,
  `reflection-scheduler`, or the transcript-specific lock. Do not replace them
  with one global lock or add timing-based tests.
- **Redact before external synchronization.** Remote mirror output must pass
  through the sync redaction layer; never copy secret-bearing raw logs or
  configuration into committed memory.
- **Facts state is durable and fail-closed.** Queue/cursor/consumed writes
  publish atomically (`.tmp` + rename, mode `0o600`) under an identity-scoped
  lock; malformed JSON parses to empty, never blocks. Enqueue/consumed
  watermarks NEVER regress, and ordering follows canonical journal position /
  snapshot boundary — never lexical message-ID comparison.
- **Behavioral patterns are NEVER stored in people cards.** Card lines are
  limited to the `IDENTITY` / `ATTRIBUTE` / `RELATIONSHIP` / `INSTRUCTION`
  prefixes with bounded metadata.

## PUBLIC SURFACES

- `runMemoryTool()` implements `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `delete`,
  `rename`, and `update_description`.
- `runMemoryApplyPatch()` applies multi-file Codex-style patches inside the
  memory repository.
- `GitMemoryRepo` owns repository initialization, clean checks, commits,
  revisions, merge worktrees, and remote detection.
- `evaluateTransitions()`, `reserveTransition()`, and
  `completeTransition()` form the pure reflection state machine.
- `compileMemoryBlock()` and `compileMemoryBlockAtRevision()` render the
  committed memory projection injected into a harness prompt.
- `FactsQueue`, `applyFactsBatch()`, `planFactsMutation()`, and
  `consumeSoulNoticeDelta()` drive the facts/soul lifecycle from
  `src/facts/` and `src/soul/`.

## CONSUMERS

Harness adapters provide identity, lifecycle events, tool registration, and
sync orchestration; the Senpi adapter lives in `packages/omo-senpi/src/components/memory/`.
Keep adapter-specific behavior there, never imported back into this package.

## QA

```bash
bun test packages/memory-core/src/
bun run --cwd packages/memory-core typecheck
```

For a focused change, run the nearest co-located `*.test.ts` first, then the
package suite. Concurrency tests must await exact state or process events with
bounded timeouts; never add fixed sleeps or retry loops.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Importing a harness package into `memory-core`.
- Writing directly to memory markdown without path validation, frontmatter
  parsing, locking, and an atomic git commit.
- Reading the dirty worktree as compiled memory.
- Mutating `read_only` blocks or accepting non-UTF-8 memory files.
- Swallowing git, lock, merge, or reflection failures.
- Testing cross-process behavior with timing luck.
