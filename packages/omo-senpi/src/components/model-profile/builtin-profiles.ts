/**
 * A model profile is a named, ordered model chain a human picks by lane
 * ("Daily · Normal", "Geeky · Heavy") instead of by model id. It is not the
 * `profiles` key in omo.json: that one is a VSCode-style config-layer overlay
 * activated by `OMO_PROFILE`.
 *
 * Every rung is a `DelegateFallbackEntry` - `{ providers, model, variant? }`, the
 * exact shape `packages/senpi-task/src/category/fallback-chains.ts` uses - and NOT
 * a single `provider/model` string, so a Copilot-only, Bedrock-only or gateway-only
 * user still resolves the model instead of reading "unavailable" while the model
 * sits right there in the registry. Provider spellings are copied from those
 * chains: senpi-only `kimi-coding` plus the leftover OpenCode `kimi-for-coding`
 * alias those chains keep, and the engine GLM ids `zai` / `zai-coding-cn` (not
 * OpenCode's `zai-coding-plan`; #8824).
 *
 * The table is additive data: an `omo.json` `model_profiles.<name>` entry replaces
 * the builtin of the same name WHOLESALE (see `resolve.ts`), so a later change
 * here can never silently override a chain a user wrote.
 *
 * There is no alias, migration, or compatibility shim for retired ids (`capable`,
 * `deep-work`, `simple-work`). A stale `model_profile` value is `unknown`.
 *
 * Builtin GPT rungs rank providers exactly like the `deep-low` / `deep-high`
 * category chains (#8737): the ChatGPT subscription first, then the `openai`
 * API/proxy lane, then Copilot and OpenCode where they serve the model. A user
 * overlay that names `openai/` is scoped to that provider.
 *
 * Unset sessions run `recommended`, which is not a lane (no family/tier): the same
 * ladder senpi's `recommended-models` builtin ships (`RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS`,
 * senpi#2074), so the TUI and the desktop start from one order. Its rungs are served
 * ONLY by their ranked lanes (`rankedProvidersOnly`): the cross-provider fallback the
 * lanes keep would otherwise pull a gateway aggregator's vendor-prefixed copy
 * (`opengateway/anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`) into the default.
