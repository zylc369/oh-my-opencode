# Known Issues

Tracks bugs that are present in the current release but have been intentionally deferred. Each entry should explain the symptom, the history, any workaround, and the planned resolution.

## #4184 - Custom provider models without `limit` do not auto-compact

- **Affects**: OpenAI-compatible custom providers whose models are written to `opencode.json` without a `limit` block.
- **Symptom**: OpenCode sees the model context as `0`, so auto-compaction never triggers and long sessions can overflow the model window.
- **Workaround**: Add a `limit` block to each custom provider model in `opencode.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "glm-5.1": {
    "name": "GLM-5.1",
    "limit": { "context": 200000, "output": 16384 }
  }
}
```

## v4.2.1 - Delegate-task early-failure-fallback (BLOCKER-4, resolved)

BLOCKER-4 is resolved in v4.2.1. Delegated child sessions now retain the first prompt payload before dispatch and consume that bootstrap payload exactly once when runtime fallback must retry an empty-history child session.

## v4.2.0 - Delegate-task early-failure-fallback (BLOCKER-4, deferred from PR #3825)

### Symptom

A delegated child session that fails on its very first `promptAsync` call (for example, the provider rejects the request before any session history is persisted) may not advance to the configured fallback models. The session ends in early failure instead of retrying with the next fallback in the chain.

This affects subagents launched via the delegate-task tool (background or sync) where the first provider call fails immediately and `session.messages` is still empty.

### History

PR #3825 (`tw-yshuang/fix/delegated-child-session-early-failure-fallback`, merged as `cd33f3a39` and then `fac90d69f` on 2026-05-07) introduced a shared bootstrap context (`src/shared/delegated-child-session-bootstrap.ts`) to capture the retry payload before the first prompt dispatch, so empty-history failures could still retry with the fallback chain.

After the merge landed on `dev`, the PR's own regression test (`delegated child-session empty-history fallback retries with captured bootstrap prompt` in `src/hooks/runtime-fallback/index.test.ts`) failed on a clean root `bun test --timeout 30000` run (6828 pass / 1 fail). PR #4044 (`code-yeongyu/revert/3825-delegated-bootstrap`, revert commit `3c7d1299a`, merge-revert commit `e2b8e49e2`, merged on 2026-05-15) reverted the merge to keep `dev` green (6823 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip across 709 files).

The original failure-mode the PR targets remains in v4.2.0.

### Workaround

- For delegated subagents, prefer providers that succeed reliably on the first call (rarely fail with auth/quota errors at request time).
- Configure fallback models conservatively in `categories[].fallback_models` and accept that the very first failure may not auto-retry.
- The existing runtime-fallback persisted-history retry path still works after the subagent produces any history.

### Tracking

Issue #4059 tracks the reland with stabilized regression coverage. The reland is deferred to a follow-up release and should account for current schema-shape changes plus prompt-async-gate semantics.

## #4225 — Custom LSP config in `.opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc` is silently ignored

- **Affects**: v4.2.3+ after the LSP to MCP migration.
- **Symptom**: Custom LSP server configuration in your project's `oh-my-openagent.jsonc` is not applied at runtime.
- **Workaround**: Configure your LSP server through OpenCode's native `lsp` config instead.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/4225.

## #4990 — Team-mode lead can stall after full quiescence

- **Affects**: Team-mode workflows where the lead and all members become idle with no unread messages or pending tasks.
- **Symptom**: The team looks finished, but the lead does not start the next turn until the user sends a manual nudge such as `are you done?`. After that nudge, the lead can call `team_status` and continue.
- **Workaround**: Before assuming the team is stuck, send one short manual nudge and ask the lead to run `team_status` plus `team_task_list`. For long multi-round runs, prefer explicit `team_task_*` state over ad-hoc message counting so the lead has a deterministic completion signal.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/4990.

## #4863 — OpenCode 1.16.x starts with only build/plan agents after install

- **Affects**: OpenCode 1.16.x with oh-my-openagent 4.7.x.
- **Symptom**: After installing oh-my-openagent, the OpenCode agent list only shows the built-in build/plan agents. `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor` can still report `System OK`, so this looks like a successful install even though the OMO agents are not visible.
- **Workaround**: Stop OpenCode, clear the OpenCode and OMO cache directories, then reinstall:

  ```sh
  rm -rf ~/.cache/opencode/ ~/.cache/oh-my-openagent/ ~/.cache/oh-my-opencode/
  bunx oh-my-openagent install
  ```

- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/4863.

## #4710: `@plan` may stay in Sisyphus instead of switching to Prometheus

- **Affects**: Current OpenCode/Ultimate planning flow.
- **Symptom**: Typing `@plan` from Sisyphus can leave the request in Sisyphus instead of handing it to Prometheus.
- **Workaround**: Switch to Prometheus first with the Tab agent selector or `/agent`, ask for the plan there, then run `/start-work` after approval.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/4710.

## #5050: OpenCode can hang during startup before the plugin runs

- **Affects**: OpenCode 1.16.2 startup with external plugins and cold package caches.
- **Symptom**: `opencode --pure` starts, but normal `opencode` clears the terminal and stalls after `service=plugin path=oh-my-openagent@latest loading plugin`.
- **Workaround**: If the hang happens before `/tmp/oh-my-opencode.log` gets a plugin entry, avoid the npm resolver path by using an absolute `file://` plugin path or by pre-populating the OpenCode package cache. If logs point to a malformed or locked `opencode.db`, back up and remove `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db*`; OpenCode recreates it on next start, but local session history is lost.
- **Status**: Open. The npm resolver timeout belongs upstream in OpenCode; tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/5050.

## #5260: Background tasks can wait on an LSP install decision

- **Affects**: Background tasks that call LSP tools when the language server is not installed.
- **Symptom**: The task reports that it is stuck on `lsp_install_decision` and waits for an install prompt instead of continuing without LSP.
- **Workaround**: Record a `declined` install decision for the missing server with `lsp_install_decision`; future LSP calls collapse to a one-line warning. To share that decision across sessions, set `LSP_TOOLS_MCP_INSTALL_DECISIONS` to a stable decisions-file path.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/5260.

## #5120: Sisyphus can loop on simple tasks

- **Affects**: OpenCode 1.17.0 with oh-my-openagent 4.8.1.
- **Symptom**: A trivial prompt such as `output hello world` can repeat the plan-style status block instead of answering directly.
- **Workaround**: For one-off trivial prompts, run `opencode --pure` or temporarily disable the plugin for that session.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/5120.

## #5105: Ralph Loop can flood logs while child subagents are active

- **Affects**: Sessions with an active Ralph Loop and background child subagents.
- **Symptom**: `/tmp/oh-my-opencode.log` repeats `promptAsync reservation release skipped for different source` while child subagents emit message events.
- **Workaround**: If you are not using Ralph Loop in that workspace, add `"disabled_hooks": ["ralph-loop"]` to `oh-my-openagent.jsonc`. If a loop is already active, run `/cancel-ralph` before disabling the hook.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/5105.

## #5025 — OpenCode Desktop loads the plugin but only shows native modes

- **Affects**: OpenCode Desktop on Windows with `oh-my-openagent@4.7.5`.
- **Symptom**: The Desktop plugin list shows `oh-my-openagent` as loaded, but the UI only exposes the native `build` and `plan` modes. The OpenCode log may include `Runtime skill source server requires Bun.serve failed to load plugin`.
- **Workaround**: Disable the runtime security skills that start the Bun-backed skill source server, then restart OpenCode Desktop:

  ```json
  {
    "disabled_skills": [
      "security-research",
      "security-review"
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/5025.

## #5021 — Codex planner or reviewer subagents can appear stuck

- **Affects**: LazyCodex / OMO Codex planner and reviewer flows that use native Codex subagents.
- **Symptom**: A parent session can receive repeated `wait_agent` timeouts while a planner or reviewer subagent remains `running`. Follow-up prompts may not recover the run, and the session can look stuck until the child agent is closed or respawned.
- **Workaround**: Use short wait cycles, send one targeted follow-up that asks the child to return a result or `BLOCKED`, then record the child as inconclusive before closing or respawning it. Do not treat repeated wait timeouts as proof that the child finished.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/5021.

## #3303 - Windows OpenCode proxy install can fail before OMO loads

- **Affects**: Windows OpenCode installs behind an HTTP(S) proxy, especially first startup paths that ask OpenCode to fetch `oh-my-openagent@latest`.
- **Symptom**: OpenCode may show only default agents or log `fetch() proxy.url must be a non-empty string` before OMO loads, so OMO hooks and doctor cannot repair the install from inside the plugin.
- **Workaround**: Launch OpenCode from a shell that has `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` set, then preinstall the package into OpenCode's Windows config prefix with `npm install oh-my-openagent@latest --prefix "%APPDATA%\\opencode"`. Restart OpenCode and verify with `bunx oh-my-openagent doctor --json`.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/3303.

## #4702 - Windows TUI plugin install can pause startup on a Bun npm git error

- **Affects**: Windows OpenCode startup when `tui.json` includes `oh-my-openagent/tui`.
- **Symptom**: OpenCode's built-in Bun npm client can spend about 62 seconds trying to install the TUI plugin before failing with `NpmInstallFailedError` and an unknown git error. Core OMO agents, skills, commands, and MCP tools still work without the TUI plugin.
- **Workaround**: Remove `oh-my-openagent/tui` from the `plugin` list in `tui.json` until the Bun npm install path is fixed.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/4702.

## #4170 - CJK characters in custom agent display names can render as mojibake

- **Affects**: OpenCode TUI sessions with custom OMO agent display names that include Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters.
- **Symptom**: The ASCII part of the agent name renders normally, but the CJK characters in the TUI header can appear garbled.
- **Workaround**: Use ASCII-only custom display names such as `Sisyphus - Orchestrator` until the TUI rendering path handles multi-byte character widths reliably.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/4170.

## #3835 / #3456 — OpenCode Desktop shows only native agents

- **Affects**: OpenCode Desktop sessions where `opencode agent list` or the TUI still shows OMO agents, but the Desktop agent selector only shows native agents such as Build and Plan.
- **Symptom**: Desktop hides Sisyphus, Hephaestus, Prometheus, Atlas, or other OMO agents even though `oh-my-openagent doctor` passes.
- **First check**: Inspect the OpenCode Desktop log for `Failed to load plugin oh-my-openagent@latest` and missing files under `~/.cache/opencode/packages/oh-my-openagent@latest/node_modules`.
- **Cache workaround**: Close Desktop, remove the `oh-my-openagent@latest` package cache, then reinstall the plugin from the same working directory with `opencode plugin oh-my-openagent@latest`.
- **Scope workaround**: If the plugin loads in one shell but not Desktop, compare the active user and project `opencode.json` files. OpenCode can read a closer project `.opencode/opencode.json` instead of the user config you inspected.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/3835 and https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/3456. This entry documents current triage steps; it does not resolve Desktop GUI rendering regressions.

## #3435 — Anthropic subscription auth may reject prompts containing `opencode`

- **Affects**: Anthropic subscription-token routes and third-party auth plugins. API-key routes may behave differently.
- **Symptom**: Anthropic returns `Third-party apps now draw from extra usage, not plan limits...` for one project while similar projects still work.
- **Likely trigger**: Upstream Anthropic filtering appears sensitive to the literal string `opencode` in custom project rules, system prompt text, or OMO's legacy prompt identifiers.
- **Workaround**: In user-controlled project files such as `AGENTS.md`, prefer `oh-my-openagent`, `OMO`, or `OpenCode` wording instead of the lowercase literal `opencode` when targeting Anthropic subscription providers.
- **Status**: Open. Tracked at https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/3435. The runtime prompt-identity cleanup still needs maintainer direction, so this workaround does not close the underlying issue.
