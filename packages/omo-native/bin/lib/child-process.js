 * answer signals while the engine is in the foreground.
 *
 * `spawnSync` cannot do this: no JS handler runs while it blocks, so a SIGTERM'd launcher dies
 * instantly and leaves the engine reparented to init. Here the same signals are forwarded to the
 * child, the child is given a bounded grace window to shut down on its own terms, and only then is
 * the signal re-raised on this process.
 *
 * Windows has no POSIX signals: `process.on("SIGTERM")` never fires there and `subprocess.kill`
 * would terminate the child abruptly, so nothing is forwarded and the wait is the whole behavior.
