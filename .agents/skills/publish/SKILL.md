name: publish
description: "Publish oh-my-opencode to npm via GitHub Actions workflow. Argument: <patch|minor|major>. Triggers: publish, release, deploy, npm publish."
---

You are the release manager for oh-my-opencode. Execute the FULL publish workflow from start to finish.

## CRITICAL: FULL WORKFLOW MEANS DISCORD TOO

Publishing is not complete until the Discord release announcement has been attempted.

- **DO NOT stop after creating the GitHub release.**
- **DO NOT stop after drafting or applying release notes.**
- **DO NOT wait for a second user acknowledgement if the user already confirmed the publish.**
- After the release notes are finalized, immediately run Step 7.5 and post to Discord.
- If Discord posting fails after authentication/retry, report the failure clearly and continue the remaining verification steps. A skipped Discord step is a workflow failure.

## CRITICAL: ARGUMENT REQUIREMENT

**You MUST receive a version bump type from the user.** Valid options:
- `patch`: Bug fixes, backward-compatible (1.1.7 → 1.1.8)
- `minor`: New features, backward-compatible (1.1.7 → 1.2.0)
- `major`: Breaking changes (1.1.7 → 2.0.0)

**If the user did not provide a bump type argument, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask:**
> "To proceed with deployment, please specify a version bump type: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`"

**DO NOT PROCEED without explicit user confirmation of bump type.**

---

## STEP 0: REGISTER TODO LIST (MANDATORY FIRST ACTION)

**Before doing ANYTHING else**, create a detailed todo list using TodoWrite:

```
[
  { "id": "confirm-bump", "content": "Confirm version bump type with user (patch/minor/major)", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "check-uncommitted", "content": "Check for uncommitted changes and commit if needed", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "sync-remote", "content": "Sync with remote (pull --rebase && push if unpushed commits)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "run-workflow", "content": "Trigger GitHub Actions publish workflow", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "wait-workflow", "content": "Wait for workflow completion (poll every 30s)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "verify-and-preview", "content": "Verify release created + preview auto-generated changelog & contributor thanks", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "draft-summary", "content": "Draft enhanced release summary (mandatory for all release types)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "apply-summary", "content": "Prepend enhanced summary to release", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "discord-announce", "content": "MANDATORY: post release announcement to Discord channel immediately after release notes are finalized", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "verify-npm", "content": "Verify npm package published successfully", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "wait-platform-workflow", "content": "Wait for publish-platform workflow completion", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "verify-platform-binaries", "content": "Verify all 7 platform binary packages published", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": "final-confirmation", "content": "Final confirmation to user with links", "status": "pending", "priority": "low" }
]
```

**Mark each todo as `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done. ONE AT A TIME.**

---

## STEP 1: CONFIRM BUMP TYPE

If bump type provided as argument, confirm with user:
> "Version bump type: `{bump}`. Proceed? (y/n)"

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## STEP 2: CHECK UNCOMMITTED CHANGES

Run: `git status --porcelain`

- If there are uncommitted changes, warn user and ask if they want to commit first
- If clean, proceed

---

## STEP 2.5: SYNC WITH REMOTE (MANDATORY)

Check if there are unpushed commits:
```bash
git log origin/master..HEAD --oneline
```

**If there are unpushed commits, you MUST sync before triggering workflow:**
```bash
git pull --rebase && git push
```

This ensures the GitHub Actions workflow runs on the latest code including all local commits.

---

## STEP 3: TRIGGER GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW

Run the publish workflow:
```bash
gh workflow run publish -f bump={bump_type}
```

Wait 3 seconds, then get the run ID:
```bash
gh run list --workflow=publish --limit=1 --json databaseId,status --jq '.[0]'
```

---

## STEP 4: WAIT FOR WORKFLOW COMPLETION

Poll workflow status every 30 seconds until completion:
```bash
gh run view {run_id} --json status,conclusion --jq '{status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion}'
```

Status flow: `queued` → `in_progress` → `completed`

**IMPORTANT: Use polling loop, NOT sleep commands.**

If conclusion is `failure`, show error and stop:
```bash
gh run view {run_id} --log-failed
```

---

## STEP 5: VERIFY RELEASE & PREVIEW AUTO-GENERATED CONTENT

Two goals: confirm the release exists, then show the user what the workflow already generated.

```bash
# Pull latest (workflow committed version bump)
git pull --rebase
NEW_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")

# Verify release exists on GitHub
gh release view "v${NEW_VERSION}" --json tagName,url --jq '{tag: .tagName, url: .url}'
```

**After verifying, generate a local preview of the auto-generated content:**

```bash
bun run script/generate-changelog.ts
```

<agent-instruction>
After running the preview, present the output to the user and say:

> **The following content is ALREADY included in the release automatically:**
> - Commit changelog (grouped by feat/fix/refactor)
> - Contributor thank-you messages (for non-team contributors)
>
> You do NOT need to write any of this. It's handled.
>
> **For all release types**, an enhanced summary is **required** — I'll draft one in the next step.

Wait for the user to acknowledge before proceeding.

If the user already confirmed the publish workflow and did not explicitly ask to review the generated changelog before release-note editing, treat the publish confirmation as sufficient acknowledgement and continue. Do not end the assistant turn here.
</agent-instruction>

---

## STEP 6: DRAFT ENHANCED RELEASE SUMMARY

<decision-gate>

| Release Type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **patch** | MANDATORY. Draft a concise bug-fix / change summary. Do NOT proceed without one. |
| **minor** | MANDATORY. Draft a concise feature summary. Do NOT proceed without one. |
| **major** | MANDATORY. Draft a full release narrative with migration notes if applicable. Do NOT proceed without one. |

</decision-gate>

### What You're Writing (and What You're NOT)

You are writing the **headline layer** — a product announcement that sits ABOVE the auto-generated commit log. Think "release blog post", not "git log".

<rules>
- NEVER duplicate commit messages. The auto-generated section already lists every commit.
- NEVER write generic filler like "Various bug fixes and improvements" or "Several enhancements".
- ALWAYS focus on USER IMPACT: what can users DO now that they couldn't before?
- ALWAYS group by THEME or CAPABILITY, not by commit type (feat/fix/refactor).
- ALWAYS use concrete language: "You can now do X" not "Added X feature".
</rules>

<examples>
<bad title="Commit regurgitation — DO NOT do this">
## What's New
- feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation
- fix(auth): handle expired token edge case
- refactor(auth): extract middleware
</bad>

<good title="User-impact narrative — DO this">
## 🔐 Smarter Authentication

Token refresh is now automatic and seamless. Sessions no longer expire mid-task — the system silently rotates credentials in the background. If you've been frustrated by random logouts, this release fixes that.
</good>

<bad title="Vague filler — DO NOT do this">
## Improvements
- Various performance improvements
- Bug fixes and stability enhancements
</bad>

<good title="Specific and measurable — DO this">
## ⚡ 3x Faster Rule Parsing

Rules are now cached by file modification time. If your project has 50+ rule files, you'll notice startup is noticeably faster — we measured a 3x improvement in our test suite.
</good>
</examples>

### Drafting Process

1. **Analyze** the commit list from Step 5's preview. Identify 2-5 themes that matter to users.
2. **Write** the summary to `/tmp/release-summary-v${NEW_VERSION}.md`.
3. **Present** the draft to the user for review and approval before applying.

```bash
# Write your draft here
cat > /tmp/release-summary-v${NEW_VERSION}.md << 'SUMMARY_EOF'
{your_enhanced_summary}
SUMMARY_EOF

cat /tmp/release-summary-v${NEW_VERSION}.md
```

<agent-instruction>
After drafting, ask the user:
> "Here's the release summary I drafted. This will appear AT THE TOP of the release notes, above the auto-generated commit changelog and contributor thanks. Want me to adjust anything before applying?"

If the user already confirmed the publish workflow and did not explicitly request a release-note review hold, proceed to Step 7 after presenting the draft. Do not stop before Step 7.5, because the Discord announcement is mandatory.
</agent-instruction>

---

## STEP 7: APPLY ENHANCED SUMMARY TO RELEASE

This step is MANDATORY. The enhanced summary from Step 6 must always be applied.

<architecture>
The final release note structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Enhanced Summary (from Step 6)     │  ← You wrote this
│  - Theme-based, user-impact focused │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ---  (separator)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Auto-generated Commit Changelog    │  ← Workflow wrote this
│  - feat/fix/refactor grouped        │
│  - Contributor thank-you messages   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
</architecture>

<zero-content-loss-policy>
- Fetch the existing release body FIRST
- PREPEND your summary above it
- The existing auto-generated content must remain 100% INTACT
- NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER of existing content may be removed or modified
</zero-content-loss-policy>

```bash
# 1. Fetch existing auto-generated body
EXISTING_BODY=$(gh release view "v${NEW_VERSION}" --json body --jq '.body')

# 2. Combine: enhanced summary on top, auto-generated below
{
  cat /tmp/release-summary-v${NEW_VERSION}.md
  echo ""
  echo "---"
  echo ""
  echo "$EXISTING_BODY"
} > /tmp/final-release-v${NEW_VERSION}.md

# 3. Update the release (additive only)
gh release edit "v${NEW_VERSION}" --notes-file /tmp/final-release-v${NEW_VERSION}.md

# 4. Confirm
echo "✅ Release v${NEW_VERSION} updated with enhanced summary."
gh release view "v${NEW_VERSION}" --json url --jq '.url'
```

---

## STEP 7.5: POST RELEASE NOTES TO DISCORD

After the release notes are finalized, post them to the Discord channel. This step is mandatory for every publish run.

<hard-gate>
The workflow is not complete until this step has either:
1. Sent a Discord message successfully and recorded the message ID, or
2. Failed after `agent-discord auth extract` plus one send retry, with the failure reported to the user.

Never skip this step because the release summary was awaiting approval. If the user already confirmed the publish, continue through Discord before stopping.
</hard-gate>

<agent-discord-instruction>
1. Ensure Discord auth is available:
```bash
agent-discord auth extract
```

2. **Read recent messages** in the channel to match the existing announcement style:
```bash
agent-discord message list 1454708427392680067 --limit 5
```

3. Post the release announcement to channel `1454708427392680067` matching the style of previous announcements. The message should follow this structure:
```
@here

🎉 **oh-my-opencode v{VERSION} — {Short Tagline}**

**Feature 1** — one-line description.

**Feature 2** — one-line description.

**Feature 3** — one-line description.

Plus {summary of remaining changes}.

📦 Install / upgrade:
`bun i -g oh-my-opencode@{VERSION}`  (or `npm`)

📝 Full release notes: {RELEASE_URL}
```

```bash
RELEASE_URL=$(gh release view "v${NEW_VERSION}" --json url --jq '.url')
agent-discord message send 1454708427392680067 "{your message following the style above}"
```

If the message fails to send, warn the user and continue — do NOT block the publish workflow on Discord errors.
</agent-discord-instruction>

---

## STEP 8: VERIFY NPM PUBLICATION

Poll npm registry until the new version appears:
```bash
npm view oh-my-opencode version
```

Compare with expected version. If not matching after 2 minutes, warn user about npm propagation delay.

---

## STEP 8.5: WAIT FOR PLATFORM WORKFLOW COMPLETION

The main publish workflow triggers a separate `publish-platform` workflow for platform-specific binaries.

1. Find the publish-platform workflow run triggered by the main workflow:
```bash
gh run list --workflow=publish-platform --limit=1 --json databaseId,status,conclusion --jq '.[0]'
```

2. Poll workflow status every 30 seconds until completion:
```bash
gh run view {platform_run_id} --json status,conclusion --jq '{status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion}'
```

**IMPORTANT: Use polling loop, NOT sleep commands.**

If conclusion is `failure`, show error logs:
```bash
gh run view {platform_run_id} --log-failed
```

---

## STEP 8.6: VERIFY PLATFORM BINARY PACKAGES

After publish-platform workflow completes, verify all 7 platform packages are published:

```bash
PLATFORMS="darwin-arm64 darwin-x64 linux-x64 linux-arm64 linux-x64-musl linux-arm64-musl windows-x64"
for PLATFORM in $PLATFORMS; do
  npm view "oh-my-opencode-${PLATFORM}" version
done
```

All 7 packages should show the same version as the main package (`${NEW_VERSION}`).

**Expected packages:**
| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `oh-my-opencode-darwin-arm64` | macOS Apple Silicon |
| `oh-my-opencode-darwin-x64` | macOS Intel |
| `oh-my-opencode-linux-x64` | Linux x64 (glibc) |
| `oh-my-opencode-linux-arm64` | Linux ARM64 (glibc) |
| `oh-my-opencode-linux-x64-musl` | Linux x64 (musl/Alpine) |
| `oh-my-opencode-linux-arm64-musl` | Linux ARM64 (musl/Alpine) |
| `oh-my-opencode-windows-x64` | Windows x64 |

If any platform package version doesn't match, warn the user and suggest checking the publish-platform workflow logs.

---

## STEP 9: FINAL CONFIRMATION

Report success to user with:
- New version number
- GitHub release URL: https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode/releases/tag/v{version}
- npm package URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/oh-my-opencode
- Platform packages status: List all 7 platform packages with their versions

---

## ERROR HANDLING

- **Workflow fails**: Show failed logs, suggest checking Actions tab
- **Release not found**: Wait and retry, may be propagation delay
- **npm not updated**: npm can take 1-5 minutes to propagate, inform user
- **Permission denied**: User may need to re-authenticate with `gh auth login`
- **Platform workflow fails**: Show logs from publish-platform workflow, check which platform failed
- **Platform package missing**: Some platforms may fail due to cross-compilation issues, suggest re-running publish-platform workflow manually

## LANGUAGE

Respond to user in English.
