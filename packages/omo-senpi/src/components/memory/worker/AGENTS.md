# memory worker

Detached `senpi -p` reflection/dream/facts child execution and the durable run lifecycle for the memory component: supervision, finalization claims, crash reconciliation, model resolution, health, and completion delivery. Children never touch git; the parent applies writes. Score ~28 (103 files, own barrel, high export/reference density).

## Anatomy

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.ts` | Barrel: completion, health, health-alert, remediation, resolve-model, runner, run-reconciliation, spawn. |
| `memory-run-supervisor.ts` | Child lifecycle: launch manifest + gated bootstrap handshake, durable run ledger, absolute hard deadline (SIGTERM->SIGKILL process group; win32 spawns non-detached with null process identity, `taskkill /T /F` tree kill, abrupt-death reconciliation resolves through the non-destructive UNKNOWN path to `abandoned.json`), `outcome.json`/`final.json` sentinels. `*.ic8.test.ts` + `memory-run-supervisor-ic8-*.ts` pin process-group/resource behavior. |
| `runner*.ts` | Reflection run execution: preflight, spawn, supervision, publication, settlement. `ReflectionRunner` / `SenpiSubprocessRunnerOptions` / `ExecutionResult` ports are injectable for tests. |
| `spawn.ts` / `spawn-supervisor.ts` / `spawn-payload.ts` / `reflection-spawn-input.ts` | Reflection/dream spawn contracts, payload materialization, supervision, and cleanup. `spawn.ts` is a thin re-export surface consumed by memory wiring and tests. Facts and the kibitzer judge run in-process via senpi-task's InProcessRunner. |
| `create-run-worktree.ts` | Isolated git worktree per reflection run. |
| `run-artifacts.ts` | Atomic JSON/text/ledger writes: temp+rename, mode 0600, with temporary cleanup on failed publication. `writeRunJsonAtomic` / `readRunJson` / `updateRunLedger` are the most-imported symbols here. |
| `run-finalization*.ts` | Terminal-state machine: claim (`-claim.ts`), gate/settlement (`-settlement.ts`), git decision (`-git.ts`), types. Matching published outcomes win races; abandoned runs are never published; inactive runs must not complete. `cleanupAndRecord` runs after the decision is durable: a worktree or branch it cannot remove records `cleanupIncomplete: true` on the ledger instead of throwing, so a landed reflection still settles. |
| `run-reconciliation.ts` | Startup scan: run directories, process liveness, sentinel waiting, state repair. Retired directories with ledger/terminal timestamps older than the active reservation do not hide a confirmed-dead launcher; historical artifacts stay intact while pending work promotes. Terminal timestamps come from `final.json.finishedAt` or `abandoned.json.abandonedAt`; missing/invalid generation timestamps raise an error without mutating reservation state. A retired-generation dir is skipped by the run-dir loop for the rest of the pass so it never settles the live reservation sharing its id. |
| `run-ghost-active.ts` | Classifies the two wedge shapes the retired-generation rule cannot see: a reservation without launcher identity (legacy record; probed for liveness when a pid survives, reclaimed outright otherwise) and a ledger older than the reservation with no terminal artifact. Classification only; the reclaim is the shared complete-as-failed + promote path and touches no artifacts. |
| `run-temporaries.ts` | Startup cleanup of run/completion JSON temporaries older than 24 hours, including terminal directories. Only complete `.json.tmp-<uuid>` or `.json.tmp-<pid>-<uuid>` suffixes match; durable `.json` records remain intact even when their run ids contain `.json.tmp-`. The PID comes from that same suffix and requires confirmed owner death; fresh files, directories, and live/unknown owners are preserved. |
| `run-reconciliation-sweep.ts` | Orphan sweep at the end of a reconciliation pass: reservation active/pending ids plus every non-terminal run dir are live, and `sweepReflectionOrphans` discards registered worktrees, stray `<epoch>-<runId>` dirs, and `memory/reflection-*` / legacy `reflection/run-*` branches older than the 15-minute grace. Deferred passes never sweep; failures warn through the injected logger and never fail the pass. |
| `run-liveness.ts` / `run-sentinel.ts` | Liveness probes and sentinel waits; the sentinel basename never fires on the relevant watcher path, so waiting degrades to a bounded timeout. |
| `resolve-model.ts` / `model-miss.ts` / `model-preflight.ts` / `model-cost.ts` / `fork-cost.ts` / `registry-fallback.ts` / `memory-launch-preflight.ts` | Model ladder: ordered candidates with cost-aware routing (`chooseMemoryLaunchRoute`), session/thinking inheritance, preflight caching, retry classification (`classifyRetryableModelMiss`). |
| `completion*.ts` | Durable completion records (`runtime/reflection/completions/`): record, deliver, render; `REFLECTION_*_ENTRY_TYPE` constants and renderer registration. |
| `health.ts` / `health-alert.ts` | READ-ONLY derived health over completion records (failure streak, fingerprint, last outcome; `senpi-memory.health` entries). A trailing streak whose newest failure is older than `REFLECTION_HEALTH_STALE_MS` (7 days) reports streak 0 so dormant identities stop alerting; historical fields stay intact. |
| `remediation.ts` | Failure-reason -> user-facing hint mapping. |
| `failure-policy.ts` / `park-alert.ts` | Park policy inputs and surface: `classifyReflectionFailure` turns a finalization decision into memory-core's `{ fingerprint, retryable }` signal (fed to `reservation.complete()` by settlement and the runner), and `emitReflectionParkAlert` announces a parked identity once per session per park episode from the durable `park.json`. |
| `entry-renderers.ts` | Notice-box renderer contract: fields joined with `" · "` (`FIELD_SEPARATOR`), normalized/truncated text, outcome glyph/color/label helpers. |

## Conventions

- Durable state transitions are separated from side effects: claim -> gate -> settle -> reconcile, each behind injectable seams (`now`, process checks, writer locks, reservation ports, subprocess runners).
- Atomic writes everywhere (temp + rename, 0600); tests use `tmpdir()` fixtures with explicit cleanup, real subprocess/filesystem/git seams, and `setDefaultTimeout` for integration cases.
- Races, crash windows, and terminal precedence are pinned by dedicated tests (`run-finalization-race`, `run-finalization-crash`, `run-terminal-precedence*`, `run-reconciliation-handoff`).

## Anti-patterns

- `health.ts` must never write - no transcript entries, no notifications, no nagging from a frozen burst.
- Never hide a pre-spawn resolution cause behind `child-stderr.log`; no child ran in that path.
- Never publish failed-child output into the memory repository; keep the cursor retryable.
- Abandoned runs must never be published; matching published outcomes win races.
- Non-retryable model failures must not consume the model chain. Provider names are assumed `/`-free; model ids may contain `/` (`model-preflight.ts`).
