/**
 * Nested host calls made INSIDE a granted parent closure run with the PARENT session's tool
 * permissions UNLESS the live capability advertises the producer's per-call execution scope
 * (senpi#1731, PR #1765, `capabilities.invokeScope === true`).
 *
 * - WITH the scope: the child's RESOLVED EFFECTIVE tool policy rides every invoke as
 *   `scope.tools`, so the closure's nested calls run CHILD-permissioned and a narrowed child is
 *   granted (`childInvokeScope`). A nested call outside the scope is refused inside the worker and
 *   lands on the child's own tool-result channel as `kernel_tool_host_denied`.
 * - WITHOUT it (an older pin): a grant must never hand a child a closure that reaches a
 *   WRITE-capable tool the child's OWN policy took away, so the grant is refused
 *   (`escalatingHostTools` + `nestedHostScopeMessage`).
 *
 * THE RULE (also stated in the changelog fragment and the PR body):
 *
 * - The child's effective host tool set is the same list the runner installs: `childStructuralToolNames`
 *   (senpi session builtins ∪ merged custom tools) minus the task/team family, minus the denylist,
 *   intersected with the allowlist whenever the resolved agent DEFINES one, even an empty one.
 * - The grant is REFUSED as `tools_unavailable` when that set is missing any write-capable name the
 *   parent closure can still reach on the same list.
 * - A name that is not in the host-tool table counts as WRITE-capable, so an unrecognised MCP or
 *   extension tool fails closed.
 * - Host-wide exclusions are NOT refusals. The UI/identity-bound tools (`memory`,
 *   `ask_user_question`, `request_user_input`) and the task/team family are withheld from EVERY
 *   child because they bind to the parent session's identity/UI or would let a child spawn its own
 *   graph - never as a reduction of what the child is permitted to cause.
