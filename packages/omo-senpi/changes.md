## 2026-10-01 - In-process task children honor the caller's settings (#9353)

- `components/task/runtime-context.ts` captures the parent session's project-trust decision, and `engine-runners.ts` passes it to every in-process child, so the child's settings include the project layer exactly when the parent's do. `plugin/extensions/omo-task.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the senpi-task change.

## 2026-10-01 - Windows RPC kills tolerate repeated Bun startup advisories (#9228)

- The task bundle treats any number of known Bun child-reaper advisory lines as advisory-only stderr for Windows code-1/no-signal exits. Any different stderr line remains a crash diagnostic.

## 2026-10-01 - Windows task-child parity regression (#9274, #6709)

- The parity regression now reloads the in-process child loader beside the process child's builtin loader policy and pins equal platform-specific builtin names plus `web_search`, avoiding Windows CLI cold starts while the existing surface tests retain shared-parent and session-default coverage.

## 2026-09-30 - Task children keep senpi builtin tools in the default in-process mode (#9274, #6709)

- The task extension bundle now gives in-process children senpi's builtin-only extension surface while continuing to suppress the parent's path-loaded extensions. The parent tool-capture wrapper stops after omo component registration, so builtin factories senpi loads later are not re-injected as raw custom tools. A mock-provider integration test compares the actual in-process and process child tool payloads and requires `web_search`.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` and `omo-task.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the senpi-task change; the extension freshness checks pass.

## 2026-10-01 - Geeky lanes: Astra at high, GPT-6.1 Sol Fast leads Geeky · Normal (#9372)

- `src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`: `geeky-heavy` runs `gpt-6-astra` at `high` (was `xhigh`). `geeky-normal`
  leads with `gpt-6.1-sol-fast` (medium, `chatgpt-subscription|openai`), then plain `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium, same lanes), then the
  unchanged `gpt-5.6-sol` (medium, all four GPT lanes). Plain 6.1 Sol stays behind the Fast tier so a registry without
  `gpt-6.1-sol-fast` still lands on 6.1 Sol rather than dropping to 5.6 Sol.
- `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs`: both geeky-heavy scenarios expect thinking `high`; new `geeky-normal-sol-fast`
  serves 5.6 Sol, 6.1 Sol and 6.1 Sol Fast and expects the Fast tier at medium.
- Tests: `index.test.ts` starts a session on each geeky-normal registry shape (Fast served -> Fast medium; Fast absent ->
  plain 6.1 Sol medium) and geeky-heavy (Astra high); removing the Fast rung fails the Fast case.

## 2026-09-30 - claude-code: acquire before the auth check, from the provisioned runtime, with progress (#9276)

- `src/components/claude-code/index.ts`: the component now also runs on `input`, which senpi's `prompt()` emits
  before `checkAuth` (`emitInput`, then `checkAuth`, then `emitBeforeAgentStart`), so a prompt from a
  `claude login`-only user downloads the executable before the ambient auth probe needs it. `before_agent_start` stays
  for turns an extension starts (they skip `input`), registered `previewSafe` and skipping the prompt-cache preview.
  The pin and cache root come from `claudeCodeRuntimeDir` (`OMO_PACKAGE_DIR`, else `dirname(execPath)`), since the
  compiled launcher pins the provisioned runtime there while `execPath` can still be the downloaded binary.
  A progress status (`omo-claude-code`: `Downloading Claude Code <version>: N% of M MB`, every 10%) shows while the
  tarball streams (`acquire.ts` `onProgress`). New `applyCachedClaudeCode` lets the compiled launcher point the engine
  at an already-downloaded copy before it starts.
- Limit: on the launch that downloads, the startup ambient probe may already have cached "not signed in" for 30 s
  (`availability.ts` `AMBIENT_STATUS_TTL_MS`); the next prompt after that window, and every later launch, resolve it.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile e2e: lane-beats-recommended-models proves a real recommended-models switch (#9238)

- `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs`: `lane-beats-recommended-models` serves `mock-1`, `glm-5.3` and
  `gpt-6-astra` on `chatgpt-subscription` + `opencode-go`, so no provider serves its engine provider default
  (`gpt-6.1-sol`, `kimi-k3`). The session starts first-available on off-ladder `mock-1`, senpi's recommended-models
  builtin switches to `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-astra`, and Daily · Normal still wins with `opencode-go/glm-5.3` max.
  The old fixture's
  only `gpt-6-sol` entry was the engine's initial provider-default record, which senpi#2393 moved to `gpt-6.1-sol`;
  the builtin never switched there. `gpt-6-astra` keeps its ladder rung across senpi#2394's Sol-slot move.
- `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e.mjs`: that scenario's checks skip the initial-model record. `started_off_recommended_ladder`
  requires the first `model_change` to be `mock-1`, and `recommended_models_switched_first` requires the builtin's
  `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-astra` change to come after it and before the lane's `opencode-go/glm-5.3`.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile: Recommended leads its GPT-6 Sol slot with gpt-6.1-sol medium, gpt-6-sol behind it (senpi#2394)

- `src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`: `recommended` replaces its `gpt-6-sol` (medium) rung with
  `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium) on `GPT_6_1_PROVIDERS` (`chatgpt-subscription|openai`), immediately followed by `gpt-6-sol`
  (medium) on the shared `GPT_PROVIDERS` ranking, so Copilot and OpenCode Zen, which do not serve 6.1 Sol, still resolve
  GPT-6 Sol. senpi#2394 makes the same switch in `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS`; OmO keeps the extra `gpt-6-sol` rung, and
  the header comment says so. The lanes are unchanged. Telemetry already carries `gpt-6.1-sol` (#9214).
- Tests: `builtin-profiles.test.ts` pins the seven-rung chain and the providers of both Sol rungs; `resolve.test.ts`
  resolves `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6.1-sol` medium when the subscription serves it next to `gpt-6-sol`, and
  `github-copilot/gpt-6-sol` medium on a Copilot-only registry; `index.test.ts` applies both at session start.
  `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs` adds `unset-gpt-6-1-sol` and `unset-copilot-gpt-6-sol`.
- Docs: the Recommended ladder in `docs/guide/agent-model-matching.md`, `docs/guide/overview.md`,
  `docs/guide/installation.md` and `docs/reference/omo-json.md`.
- `plugin/extensions/` bundles regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the chain change.

## 2026-09-30 - lsp: post-edit install nudges stay inside projects and appear once per server (#9223)

- `components/lsp/post-edit-outcome.ts` (moved out of `index.ts`) turns a daemon `not_installed` availability into the structured post-edit outcome, carrying `serverId`, `installDecisionTool` and a recorded decision.
- `components/lsp/index.ts` `handlePostEditDiagnosticsToolResult` classifies each edited file against the session cwd and the engine-resolved agent dir (`resolveSessionAgentDir`, else `resolveAgentHome`): files outside a project, in the agent dir, or in a temp dir get no nudge, and each server is nudged once per session (reset on compaction).
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` regenerated on linux for the change above.

## 2026-09-30 - memory/kibitzer: connected-first sidecar model order (#9216)

- `components/memory/kibitzer/sidecar-connected-order.ts` (new) `orderKibitzerCandidatesByConnection`: with a known, non-empty availability list the first connected candidate leads and unconnected ones trail; none connected returns the providers to connect.
- `components/memory/kibitzer/sidecar-model.ts` `resolveKibitzerSidecarModel` applies it to category-sourced resolutions and returns `category_unavailable` when nothing is connected. The `task` tool path is untouched.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the change above; `build-extension.mjs --check` and `build-install.mjs --check` pass on the regenerated tree.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile: Geeky · Normal leads with gpt-6.1-sol medium; telemetry knows the 6.1 Sol ids (#9214)

- `src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`: `geeky-normal` is `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium) on `chatgpt-subscription|openai`
  (the new `GPT_6_1_PROVIDERS`: Copilot and OpenCode Zen do not serve 6.1 Sol, and every builtin rung must name a pair the
  product knows), then `gpt-5.6-sol` (medium) on the shared `GPT_PROVIDERS` ranking. The `recommended` row and every other
  profile are unchanged.
- `src/components/telemetry/model-vocabulary.ts`: `gpt-6.1-sol` and `gpt-6.1-sol-fast` join the `chatgpt-subscription`,
  `openai` and `openai-codex` vocabularies and `gpt-6.1-sol` the `vercel` one, so the new deep-low rungs export as themselves
  instead of `custom`; `docs/reference/senpi-telemetry.md` is regenerated from the schemas.
- Tests: `builtin-profiles.test.ts` pins the two-rung chain, `resolve.test.ts` resolves `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6.1-sol`
  medium when the subscription serves both, and `index.test.ts` applies it at session start; the Copilot-only and GPT-6-only
  cases still resolve 5.6 Sol and report unavailable. `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs` `geeky-normal-sol` serves
  `gpt-6.1-sol` next to `gpt-5.6-sol` and expects 6.1 Sol.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js`, `omo-task.js`, `omo-init-deep-advisor.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for
  the chain, profile and vocabulary changes; `omo-member.js`, `memory-run-supervisor.mjs` and `omo-computer-use.js` rebuilt
  byte-identical, so they are unchanged.

## 2026-09-29 - plugin bundles carry the typed launch_spec_insecure start failure (#9208)

- `plugin/extensions/omo-task.js`, `omo-member.js`, `omo.js` (source-digest marker only) and `plugin/runtime/rollback-migrate.js`
  regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the senpi-task change: a task host that refuses a group- or
  world-writable launch spec now fails the start typed `launch_spec_insecure` with the spec path and `chmod 644 <path>`,
  and rollback strips the new reason like every post-R0 reason. No adapter source changed.

## memory, telemetry: Kibitzer recall runs on a Z.ai-only or Xiaomi-only machine (#9202)

- `memory/kibitzer/sidecar-model.test.ts`: with only `zai` or only `xiaomi` logged in and no quick config, the sidecar
  resolves `zai/glm-5.3-flash` or `xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` at `low`. On dev both refused with `beyond_category`,
  because the quick chain had no rung for them. The chain change is in senpi-task.
- `telemetry/model-vocabulary.ts`: adds `glm-5.3-flash` under `zai` and `zai-coding-cn`, and `mimo-v2.6-flash` under
  `xiaomi`, so the new rungs export by name. `docs/reference/senpi-telemetry.md` is regenerated.

## thread, task: agent state stays out of the user's repository (#9201, DESKTOP-31)

- `components/thread/live-surface.ts` `defaultThreadStateDirectory`: the thread tools' mailbox and receipts move from
  `<project>/.omo/thread-tools` to the same per-project folder as the task state
  (`@oh-my-opencode/senpi-task` `resolveProjectStateDirectory`); a pre-existing in-project folder keeps being used.
- `components/task/engine-state-dir.test.ts`: a fresh project stays empty after the engine persists task state, a
  pre-existing `.omo/senpi-task` is kept, and `task.state_dir` wins.
- Root `test-setup.ts` drops an inherited `OMO_`/`SENPI_`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, so a test run started inside a live
  session resolves agent-dir state under the hermetic HOME, as in CI.

## skill-commands, skills: argument-taking skills wait for their arguments in the slash picker (#9168)

- `skills/{hyperplan,init-deep,mass-ulw,ulw-loop,ulw-plan,ulw-research}/SKILL.md` and the shared-pool
  `ulw-execute`, `refactor` and `remove-ai-slops` declare `argument-hint`. From senpi#2258 on, the picker reads it
  (`Skill.argumentHint`) and Enter on a `skill:<name>` row fills `/skill:<name> ` and waits instead of submitting the
  skill empty. Skills that take no arguments stay hint-less and still submit on one Enter.
- `components/skill-commands/autocomplete.ts`: a bare alias row mirrors its own `skill:<name>` row on the same page,
  taking its description (which carries the hint) and `awaitsArguments`, so `/ulw-execute` waits exactly when
  `/skill:ulw-execute` does. `pi.getCommands()` carries no hint, so the page row is the source. Without the skill row
  the alias falls back to the command description and submits as before.
- `components/skill-commands/argument-hints.test.ts` parses every shipped SKILL.md with the engine's own
  `parseFrontmatter` (native copy over the shared one, as `sync-skills.mjs` ships them) and pins the set of hinted
  skills.

## computer-use, x-search: a feature skill yields to a loaded same-name skill and honors disabled_skills (#9160)

- `components/bundled-skills/contributed-skill.ts`: `resolveContributedSkill` decides one `resources_discover` pass for a
  skill a component contributes on its own. `disabled_skills` hides it (`readDisabledSkills`, now shared with the
  bundled-skills component). A `skill:<name>` entry in `pi.getCommands()` whose `sourceInfo.path` is not ours means
  senpi already loaded a same-name skill, which wins first-path either way, so ours is withheld instead of becoming a
  "Skill conflicts" collision. Our own path left over from an earlier pass still contributes.
- `components/computer-use/index.ts`: the `computer-use` skill goes through it; `/computer status` adds
  `skill: your own computer-use skill is active in place of the built-in guide (<path>)` when it yielded. New `env`
  option for the config read.
- `components/x-search/index.ts`: the conditional `x-search` skill goes through it. Both tools stay registered.
- `extension/types.ts`: `getCommands()` entries carry the optional `sourceInfo.path` senpi already reports.

## memory: a late Kibitzer verdict no longer steers an extra turn after the final answer

- `components/memory/kibitzer/delivery.ts`: an accepted verdict steers at once only while the running session has a
  tool call executing. The host reads its steering queue after every turn, so a steer queued once the final answer
  was streaming or streamed started one more assistant turn after it; a headless `senpi -p` consumer that posts only
  the last assistant text then lost the real answer (observed as `answer -> omo-kibitzer:recall -> "NO_REPLY"`). Such a
  verdict is now held for the next `tool_result` steer or the next prompt's drain, like any other held nudge.
- `components/memory/kibitzer/hooks.ts`: `tool_call` / `tool_result` report the executing call ids to delivery, and a
  new `turn_end` hook clears them so a call that never reports a result (blocked, aborted) cannot outlive its turn.

## model-profile, task: builtin lanes and the category notice never route to an unlisted gateway (#9146)

- `components/model-profile/resolve.ts`: every builtin rung, in `recommended` and in the `daily-*`/`geeky-*` lanes, is
  served only by its listed providers, so a lane never lands the session on a gateway's copy of its model
  (`opengateway/anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`). A lane no listed provider serves is `unavailable` and keeps the session
  model with the existing one-line notice. A user's bare model id, which names no provider, still matches anywhere.
  `rankedProvidersOnly` is gone: it was the only builtin that had the listed-only rule, which is now the rule.
- `components/task/category-unavailable-warning.ts`: when only an unlisted provider serves a hidden category's chain,
  the one notice per session names it and the exact opt-in line
  (`categories.<name>.model = "<gateway>/<model>"`); `details.unlisted_provider_model` carries it for remote clients.
