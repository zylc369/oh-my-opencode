## 2026-09-30 - lsp: post-edit install nudges stay inside projects and appear once per server (#9223)

- `components/lsp/post-edit-outcome.ts` (moved out of `index.ts`) turns a daemon `not_installed` availability into the structured post-edit outcome, carrying `serverId`, `installDecisionTool` and a recorded decision.
- `components/lsp/index.ts` `handlePostEditDiagnosticsToolResult` classifies each edited file against the session cwd and the engine-resolved agent dir (`resolveSessionAgentDir`, else `resolveAgentHome`): files outside a project, in the agent dir, or in a temp dir get no nudge, and each server is nudged once per session (reset on compaction).
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` regenerated on linux for the change above.

## 2026-09-30 - memory/kibitzer: connected-first sidecar model order (#9216)

- `components/memory/kibitzer/sidecar-connected-order.ts` (new) `orderKibitzerCandidatesByConnection`: with a known, non-empty availability list the first connected candidate leads and unconnected ones trail; none connected returns the providers to connect.
- `components/memory/kibitzer/sidecar-model.ts` `resolveKibitzerSidecarModel` applies it to category-sourced resolutions and returns `category_unavailable` when nothing is connected. The `task` tool path is untouched.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the change above; `build-extension.mjs --check` and `build-install.mjs --check` pass on the regenerated tree.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile: Geeky · Normal leads with gpt-6.1-sol medium; telemetry knows the 6.1 Sol ids (#9214)

- `src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`: `geeky-normal` is `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium) on `chatgpt-subscription|openai`
  (the new `GPT_6_1_PROVIDERS`: Copilot and OpenCode Zen do not serve 6.1 Sol, and every builtin rung must name a pair the
  product knows), then `gpt-5.6-sol` (medium) on the shared `GPT_PROVIDERS` ranking. The `recommended` row and every other
  profile are unchanged.
- `src/components/telemetry/model-vocabulary.ts`: `gpt-6.1-sol` and `gpt-6.1-sol-fast` join the `chatgpt-subscription`,
  `openai` and `openai-codex` vocabularies and `gpt-6.1-sol` the `vercel` one, so the new deep-low rungs export as themselves
  instead of `custom`; `docs/reference/senpi-telemetry.md` is regenerated from the schemas.
- Tests: `builtin-profiles.test.ts` pins the two-rung chain, `resolve.test.ts` resolves `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6.1-sol`
  medium when the subscription serves both, and `index.test.ts` applies it at session start; the Copilot-only and GPT-6-only
  cases still resolve 5.6 Sol and report unavailable. `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs` `geeky-normal-sol` serves
  `gpt-6.1-sol` next to `gpt-5.6-sol` and expects 6.1 Sol.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js`, `omo-task.js`, `omo-init-deep-advisor.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for
  the chain, profile and vocabulary changes; `omo-member.js`, `memory-run-supervisor.mjs` and `omo-computer-use.js` rebuilt
  byte-identical, so they are unchanged.

## 2026-09-29 - plugin bundles carry the typed launch_spec_insecure start failure (#9208)

- `plugin/extensions/omo-task.js`, `omo-member.js`, `omo.js` (source-digest marker only) and `plugin/runtime/rollback-migrate.js`
  regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the senpi-task change: a task host that refuses a group- or
  world-writable launch spec now fails the start typed `launch_spec_insecure` with the spec path and `chmod 644 <path>`,
  and rollback strips the new reason like every post-R0 reason. No adapter source changed.

## memory, telemetry: Kibitzer recall runs on a Z.ai-only or Xiaomi-only machine (#9202)

- `memory/kibitzer/sidecar-model.test.ts`: with only `zai` or only `xiaomi` logged in and no quick config, the sidecar
  resolves `zai/glm-5.3-flash` or `xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` at `low`. On dev both refused with `beyond_category`,
  because the quick chain had no rung for them. The chain change is in senpi-task.
- `telemetry/model-vocabulary.ts`: adds `glm-5.3-flash` under `zai` and `zai-coding-cn`, and `mimo-v2.6-flash` under
  `xiaomi`, so the new rungs export by name. `docs/reference/senpi-telemetry.md` is regenerated.

## thread, task: agent state stays out of the user's repository (#9201, DESKTOP-31)

- `components/thread/live-surface.ts` `defaultThreadStateDirectory`: the thread tools' mailbox and receipts move from
  `<project>/.omo/thread-tools` to the same per-project folder as the task state
  (`@oh-my-opencode/senpi-task` `resolveProjectStateDirectory`); a pre-existing in-project folder keeps being used.
- `components/task/engine-state-dir.test.ts`: a fresh project stays empty after the engine persists task state, a
  pre-existing `.omo/senpi-task` is kept, and `task.state_dir` wins.
- Root `test-setup.ts` drops an inherited `OMO_`/`SENPI_`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, so a test run started inside a live
  session resolves agent-dir state under the hermetic HOME, as in CI.

## skill-commands, skills: argument-taking skills wait for their arguments in the slash picker (#9168)

- `skills/{hyperplan,init-deep,mass-ulw,ulw-loop,ulw-plan,ulw-research}/SKILL.md` and the shared-pool
  `ulw-execute`, `refactor` and `remove-ai-slops` declare `argument-hint`. From senpi#2258 on, the picker reads it
  (`Skill.argumentHint`) and Enter on a `skill:<name>` row fills `/skill:<name> ` and waits instead of submitting the
  skill empty. Skills that take no arguments stay hint-less and still submit on one Enter.
- `components/skill-commands/autocomplete.ts`: a bare alias row mirrors its own `skill:<name>` row on the same page,
  taking its description (which carries the hint) and `awaitsArguments`, so `/ulw-execute` waits exactly when
  `/skill:ulw-execute` does. `pi.getCommands()` carries no hint, so the page row is the source. Without the skill row
  the alias falls back to the command description and submits as before.
- `components/skill-commands/argument-hints.test.ts` parses every shipped SKILL.md with the engine's own
  `parseFrontmatter` (native copy over the shared one, as `sync-skills.mjs` ships them) and pins the set of hinted
  skills.

## computer-use, x-search: a feature skill yields to a loaded same-name skill and honors disabled_skills (#9160)

- `components/bundled-skills/contributed-skill.ts`: `resolveContributedSkill` decides one `resources_discover` pass for a
  skill a component contributes on its own. `disabled_skills` hides it (`readDisabledSkills`, now shared with the
  bundled-skills component). A `skill:<name>` entry in `pi.getCommands()` whose `sourceInfo.path` is not ours means
  senpi already loaded a same-name skill, which wins first-path either way, so ours is withheld instead of becoming a
  "Skill conflicts" collision. Our own path left over from an earlier pass still contributes.
- `components/computer-use/index.ts`: the `computer-use` skill goes through it; `/computer status` adds
  `skill: your own computer-use skill is active in place of the built-in guide (<path>)` when it yielded. New `env`
  option for the config read.
- `components/x-search/index.ts`: the conditional `x-search` skill goes through it. Both tools stay registered.
- `extension/types.ts`: `getCommands()` entries carry the optional `sourceInfo.path` senpi already reports.

## memory: a late Kibitzer verdict no longer steers an extra turn after the final answer

- `components/memory/kibitzer/delivery.ts`: an accepted verdict steers at once only while the running session has a
  tool call executing. The host reads its steering queue after every turn, so a steer queued once the final answer
  was streaming or streamed started one more assistant turn after it; a headless `senpi -p` consumer that posts only
  the last assistant text then lost the real answer (observed as `answer -> omo-kibitzer:recall -> "NO_REPLY"`). Such a
  verdict is now held for the next `tool_result` steer or the next prompt's drain, like any other held nudge.
- `components/memory/kibitzer/hooks.ts`: `tool_call` / `tool_result` report the executing call ids to delivery, and a
  new `turn_end` hook clears them so a call that never reports a result (blocked, aborted) cannot outlive its turn.

## model-profile, task: builtin lanes and the category notice never route to an unlisted gateway (#9146)

- `components/model-profile/resolve.ts`: every builtin rung, in `recommended` and in the `daily-*`/`geeky-*` lanes, is
  served only by its listed providers, so a lane never lands the session on a gateway's copy of its model
  (`opengateway/anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`). A lane no listed provider serves is `unavailable` and keeps the session
  model with the existing one-line notice. A user's bare model id, which names no provider, still matches anywhere.
  `rankedProvidersOnly` is gone: it was the only builtin that had the listed-only rule, which is now the rule.
- `components/task/category-unavailable-warning.ts`: when only an unlisted provider serves a hidden category's chain,
  the one notice per session names it and the exact opt-in line
  (`categories.<name>.model = "<gateway>/<model>"`); `details.unlisted_provider_model` carries it for remote clients.
