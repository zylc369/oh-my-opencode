 * Runtime fallback's handoff between two rungs. The failed rung's child is closed and the next rung
 * has not been spawned yet, so for that span the task has no child of its own: no pid, no daemon
 * session. The record says so explicitly (`fallback_handoff_epoch` equal to its run_epoch), because
 * a pid-less process record is otherwise indistinguishable from a queued or workpool child.
 *
 * Two readers depend on it. Reconciliation keeps a live owner's handoff behind the pid fence and
 * revives a dead owner's handoff instead of losing it, and revival launches the SELECTED next model
 * fresh from the persisted spawn spec: the failed rung's transcript ends in its error, so reopening
 * it would report the task resumed while no turn runs.
